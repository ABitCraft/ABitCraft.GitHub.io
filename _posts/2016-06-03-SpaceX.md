我在写这篇文章的时候，希望确保每一位读者最后都在同一起跑线上，毕竟这些事情正在发生，我们都有权去了解。所以就像上一篇Tesla文，这篇文章也是全剧情讲解。

谢谢大家的耐心！我知道你可能默默希望这个网站不要两个月才更新一次，我也是这样希望的（译者也是这样希望的）。Tesla 和 Space X 是特殊情况，搞定完这两篇后你就会看到正常更新速度和长度的WBW文章了。

公元2365年，木卫三（Ganymede）

离出发还有一天。去到那里的景象感觉像梦一样，仍让她难以置信。那些她一直向往的传说：在第一批人类到达木卫三好几百年之前修的建筑，像房屋一样大的动物，和她的星球一样大的大海，热带的沙滩，著名的蓝天，巨大到可以晒伤皮肤的太阳，以及最诡异的：居然没有木星在头上盘旋。曾经无数次在电影中看过的这些画面让她感觉像是要去一个电影拍摄地。 这一切都来得太突然。不过现在她要认认真真准备好行李，确保和每一个爱的人说再见，因为下一次再见到他们应该是很久以后了... ...

第一部分：人类和太空的故事

大概在六百万年前，一位非常重要的母猿生了两个孩子。其中一个孩子变成了所有大猩猩的祖先。另外一个孩子则繁衍出一支物种，这支物种最终演化成了人类。 尽管第一位孩子最后变的非常平凡以及有点猴子那种风格时，随着时间的推移，另外一位孩子的后代却发生了奇妙的变化。

我们也不太清楚为什么，但在接下来的六百万年里，我们的祖先们开始做一些地球上其他生物从未做过的事情：他们觉醒了。

这是通过了几千代人逐步演变的过程，就如你在清醒前的漫长睡眠。随着头脑越来越清醒，我们的祖先开始四处张望，有史以来第一次，感到好奇。 

从36亿年的梦境中醒来，这些地球上的生物第一次有了疑问。

这个巨大的空间是什么，谁把我们放在这里的？上面那个黄色的光盘是什么，晚上他又去了哪里？大海的尽头在哪里，那里有什么呢？那些死去的人去哪里了？他们都消失了吗？

我们已摸索出本物种最伟大的推理小说：《我们在哪里？》

我们想要学着读懂它。

随着人类的意识逐渐清醒，我们开始找到了一些似乎蛮合理的答案。可能我们是在一个悬浮起来的圆盘顶端，而这个圆盘呢，大概在一个巨型乌龟的背上。也有可能夜晚时头上那些点点光芒后面是一个大屋顶，大概我们死后就会去那里吧。也有可能当我们找到了屋顶和地面相连的地方，把头一钻，还可以发现世界另一边一些嗨森的东西呢。

大概在一万年前，一些独立的人类部落开始聚集在一起，形成了世界上的第一座城市。在大一点的群落里，人们可以向其他人分享这些推理小说的线索，并且和每个部落不同的笔记相比较，代代相传。随着科技的进步和线索的积累，一些新的发现开始浮出水面。

原来这个世界不是圆盘，而是一个球体。也就是说天花板实际上是一个围绕着我们的大一点的球。漂浮在我们旁边的物体，不管是距离还是size，都比我们想象的大得多多了。而且，不幸的是:
太阳并没有围着我们转，是我们在围着太阳转。
这也是呵呵了，无情的消息。我们怎么可能不在中心呢，这是几个意思？

我们到底在哪里？

球形天花板已经是很无情的大了，如果我们不在它中心的话，难道我们只里面一个随机的球体甲吗？没有什么特殊意义就出现的那种？这是真的吗？



恐怖哦。
然后事情进一步地无情了。

天花板尽头的那些点点光芒貌似也并不是我们幻想中的那样，他们是和我们的太阳一样的其他太阳们。而且和我们的太阳一样，也悬浮在那里，也就是说我们根本就不在球形天花板里面。
不仅我们不是世界的中心，连我们的太阳也仅仅是外面的一个普通小伙子，随机漂浮在那里，周围什么都没有。



恐怖哦。
然后发现，我们的太阳原来在一个更大的东西里。一个美丽的，无比巨大的，包含着无数太阳的星云里。所有的所有里。



至少我们还有一个星云。然后，当我们意识到真实的情况其实是：



一片黑暗。

随着我们的工具和理解能力越来越好，我们可以将画面拉的更远。而拉得越远，就越恐怖。当我们冒着生命危险推理出了《我们在哪里？》时，也推理出我们不可置信地异常孤独，住在孤岛里的孤岛里的孤岛里，忍受着各种孤寂，找不到人倾诉。

这就是咱们的处境。

在我们这个物种短暂存在的最近百分之一的时间里，我们演变成地球上第一种最了解剧情的生物，并且体验到了前所未有的集体生存危机。

不过也不怪我们。你想，从不知道宇宙这个东西到意识到宇宙的存在，需要承受的也太多了...

我们大部分人处理这种情况都是采取“活在可爱的幻觉中”这种方法，假装这个唯一的星球有着无穷无尽的绚丽和温暖。我们就像这个小伙子一样，采取各种方法来忽视他的处境：


(图自：Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah, Disney, 1964)

这种忽视处境之方法的老朋友是？呵呵，就是那有名的蓝天。蓝天似乎是专门为了让人类假装现实不存在而被发明出来的，它的角色就是扮演一个常常变化的的背景墙，将我们挡在现实的外面。

直到夜晚，现实才显现出来，直接打在我们脸上。



Oh yeah  …

于是：嘻嘻嘻 → Oh yeah → 嘻嘻嘻 → Oh yeah … 这种坐旋转木马的神w经质，完美诠释了在最近的历史里，我们和现实的关系。

但在过去的60年里，这个关系迈向了新的台阶。在第二次世界大战期间，导弹科技向前迈进了一大步。而且史上第一次，一个新的，脑洞超大的概念成为了可能：

太空旅行。

（注：其实是德国最早有了世界领先的火箭科技，但他们输掉二战后，美国，苏联和英国抢走了不少德国的火箭专家们。美国可能抢得最成功，抓到了Wernher von Braun，他最后带领美国建造了登上月球的火箭，“土星”5号运载火箭(Saturn V) ）

几千年以来，人类和太空的故事一直都是看一看瞧一瞧的剧情。而人类可以离开地球孤岛去太空探险的可能性, 让人类的冒险精神完全爆发。

我自行感受了一下15世纪人们的想法。 在那个摸索的年代里，当人类被跨洋旅行迷得眼花缭乱， 描画着《我们在哪里？——之世界地图》时（坎迪诺平面球形图），若你问一个1495年的小盆友长大想做什么，最普遍的回答应该是：“航海探险家！”

而当你问一位1970年的的小盆友长大想做什么时，回答则应该是：“宇航员！” ——现实探险家。

二战提升了太空旅行的可能性，但一直到1957年后期，当苏联将第一个人造物体（可爱的Sputnik 1，斯普特尼克1号）发射到地球轨道上时，太空旅行才变成定义“世界最强帝国” 的条件。

在那时，冷战正是最严重的时候，美国和苏联将他们的竞争上升到了两国间的JJ较量，国际直播的那种。因为Sputnik 1的成功发射，苏联的JJ猛涨几厘米，吓傻美国同胞。




对于苏联来说，赶在美帝之前把卫星送上天可以证明他们的科技优于美国科技，进一步也可以向世界证明，共产主义是优于资本主义的。

八个月后，NASA就诞生了。

太空争霸赛就这样开始了。NASA的第一单生意就是将一个人类送往太空，然后将一个人类送往绕地轨道，最好都是赶在苏联之前。美国不想再被苏联打脸了。

1959年，NASA发布了 Project Mercury（水星计划）。1961年四月，当美国正在成功的边缘时，苏联将Yuri Gagarin （尤里·加加林）送上了太空，并完整地绕地一圈，让苏联人成为了世界上第一个进入太空和绕地轨道的人类。



激烈的撕＊大战开始了。约翰肯尼迪的智囊团向他建议道，苏联在任何一个近期成就中都可以完爆美国，但如果能第一个将载人航天飞船送上月球，却可以完完全全打败苏联。于是肯尼迪发表了他那著名的演讲：“我们决定登月，不是因为那很容易，而是因为那十分困～难～！” （大家可以百度“我们选择登月”——译者），这直接引出了投资在该项目上的天文数字 ：200亿美元，换算成现在的价值是2050亿，美元。

这个项目就是Project Apollo（阿波罗登月计划）。阿波罗的使命是让一位美国人登上月球，而且要先登上。苏联则是用Soyuz号载人航天器（联盟号飞船）和他们的秘密登月计划来给自己加分。 争霸进行中。

当阿波罗号开开心心地完成初始阶段时， Project Mercury 也开始争气了。在加加林成为太空第一人的一个月之后，美国宇航员Alan Shepard 成为了太空第二人。虽然没有绕轨道一圈，只完成了一个圆弧旅行，但还是让他有机会和太空来了个High-five。 几个月后，1962年二月，John Glenn 成为了第一个完成轨道飞行的美国宇航员。

在接下来的7年里，世界强国美帝和苏联进行了22次载人航天器发射，各种科技，各种技术的磨练和改进。在1968年后期，进入猛烈冲刺阶段的美国进行了更多次的发射（17次），多于苏联的10次发射。两国已携手掌握了被他们称为“近地轨道”（Low Earth Orbit (LEO) ）的空间。



然而在60年代早期，近地轨道也没有让人太嗨。两大强国都将他们的愿景投向了月球。阿波罗项目加快了步伐，1968年11月，美国成为了第一个攀升到近地轨道之外的国家。阿波罗八号还进入了月球轨道并环绕月球大约10圈，才安全回来抵达地面。这个项目的班子包括James Lovell（他还在汤姆汉克斯的电影“阿波罗13号”中扮演了角色）在内，完全碾压了人类历史记录上所能到达的最高高度，成为第一批最近距离观察到月球的人类，也是第一批看到月球背面的人类，也是第一批看到整个地球的人类。他们照下了一下这张标志性的图像：


（图据：维基百科：Apollo 8）

在返回地球的当下，这个班子就变成了美国最有名望的英雄们，我衷心希望他们尽情享受了那8个月的美好时光。在达成了阿波罗计划的三个使命后，1969年7月，阿波罗11号让美国宇航员Neil Armstrong和Buzz Aldrin 成为了登上月球的第一批人类。Armstrong还给Aldrin照了这张著名的肥肥相片：


（图据：维基百科：Buzz Aldrin）

我很难向大家表达这是多么了不起。36亿年以来，从未有一个地球物种踏足于地表之外。突然，我们有了Armstrong和Aldrin，在另一个球体上蹦跶着，像看着月球那样看着我们的地球。太丧病了。

不仅仅是阿波罗号赶在苏联之前登上了月球，这个项目还在接下来的三年半时间里达成了五项使命，将另外十名宇航员送上了月球。七次尝试中有六次都成功了。著名的那一次失败就是阿波罗13号，在飞行两天后氧气罐爆炸，不得不终止计划，但仍安全地返回了地球。

而苏联的 Soyuz Program 却不断遭到技术问题，没能成功地将人送上月球。

最后一次阿波罗月上行走完成于1972年。在短短的十年内，我们战胜了临近的太空，前进的步伐也在加速着。如果在那时你随便问一名美国人，或者是其他任何人类，接下来的十年内太空旅行将会带来什么，他们会做出许多大胆的预测：送更多的人上月球啦，建造永久的月球基地啦，将人类送上火星，等等各种。

于是乎你可想象，在1972年， 当你告诉那些亲眼见证了12名人类成功登月的人们，43年后，在听起来十分科幻带感的2015年，登月的人数仍然是12时，他们将会多么吃惊。或者是告诉他们，在那个年代近地轨道虽已作为了登上月球前的热身运动场，但在遥远的2015年，近地轨道仍然是人类去过的最远的地方... …

1972年的人们可能会惊讶于我们的手机和网络，但也会惊讶于我们停止了太空的探索。

到底发生了什么呢？在激动人心的十年太空冒险后，是什么让我们停止了呢？

呵呵。就像之前我们在Tesla文里发现的一样，“我们为什么停止？”是一个错误的问题。我们应该问： 

为什么一开始我们会大胆地将人类送往太空呢？

太空旅行简直就是不可置信的昂贵。而国家的预算又是不可置信地吃紧。其实，一个国家为了去探险，鼓舞人心和挑战极限而砸下一整块预算也是挺少见的。

事实上从来就没有一个国家为了去探险，鼓舞人心和挑战极限而死命的砸钱。这两个国家花了钱是因为他们正在进行JJ长短的硬碰硬较量。 但后来的情况变成了大家都在比较谁的经济体系更好，为了能在国际舞台上hold住面子，美国政府决定降低常年的预算，把钱花在需要的地方，这样一来他们就可以赢得“谁的经济体系更好”这项比赛——


（图据：维基百科：Budget of NASA)

而一旦他们赢得了这场比赛，国际争霸赛也就结束了。不过特殊的争霸赛规则也结束了。美国回到了像普通人一样花钱的日子。


（图据：维基百科：Budget of NASA)

美国和苏联两手紧紧相握，不再像以前一样各自花钱如流水，提起裤子像大人一样开始携手工作：他们开始共同建造低地轨道上的国际空间站。


从那时开始的四十年内，人类和太空的故事又限制在了地球上。这时和太空的互动主要有以下两个原因：
（注：接下来的一大部分是一个小消遣，大致介绍了人造卫星，航天探测器以及太空望远镜。如果这些小玩意儿不能让你嗨起来的话，我不会介意你直接跳到国际空间站那一部分～）


原因一：向地面上的产业提供支持


自阿波罗号以来，将人类送上太空的第一个也是最主要的一个原因并不是为了满足人类的兴趣爱好。而是为了利用太空向地球上的产业提供实质性的帮助（比如人造卫星的组建）。现今的火箭发射套装只是将物体发射到近地轨道上，着眼于地球，而不是放眼于另一边广阔的太空。

以下是一些关于卫星的介绍：

卫星蓝框：

我们经常无视头顶上的这上百个小机器人，但在日常生活中它们扮演了很重要的角色。1957年，只有孤独的Sputnik卫星（伴侣号）在绕着地球转，然而现在，通讯系统，天气预报，电视，导航和天线都需要依赖卫星，同样包括一些国防部和政府情报局。

生产和发射卫星的产业、相关设备和服务产业的总市价已经从2004年的6亿美元大幅上涨到了2015年的20亿美元。现今卫星产业的收益仅占全球电信行业的4%，但却占了航空行业的60%（SIA 2014 Report）。

下图解释了世界上卫星们的各种角色（2013年）：


（图据：SIA 2014 Report)

自2015年以来，一共有1265个卫星活跃在地球轨道上，其中美国有着数量最多的卫星：528个，占了总数的40%。超过50个国家都至少拥有一个轨道卫星。

大部分的卫星都在空间上这两个独立的区域里：

约有三分之二的卫星活跃在近地轨道上。近地轨道从离地99英里（160公里）的高空开始算起，那个地方没有大气阻力来捣乱。低地轨道的最高点有1240英里（2000公里）。 技术上来讲，离地面最近的卫星有大概220英里（350公里），或者高一点儿。

剩余的（大概三分之一）卫星要远的多，那个地方叫做geostationary orbit (GEO，地球同步轨道)。这个轨道在离地球22236英里（35786公里）的上空。之所以被叫做地球同步轨道，是因为在其中卫星绕轨道运行的速度和地球自转的速度是完全一样的，因此它可以相对静止在地球上的某一点。在地球上看就像没动一样。


地球同步轨道非常适合电视卫星这种每时每刻需要固定通讯的东西。

也有一小部分卫星在 Medium Earth Orbit (MEO, 中地球轨道)上，他介于低地轨道和地球同步轨道之间。里面最有名的业界一哥就是现在地球上很多人都在使用的GPS系统。让我万万没想到的是，整个GPS系统，这个从1995年美国国防部就开始运行的系统，总共只用了32个卫星。到2012年，只用了24个了：六个轨道，每个轨道上有四个卫星。 你可以在下图中看到，随便在地球上给个点，在任何时间里，其中至少六个卫星都可以把这个点找出来。而实际情况下通常是九个卫星找出来，或者更多，请看动图：（图中，地球上的蓝点是一个假定小人，可以在任何给予时间点找到他的卫星是蓝色的，绿色虚线是卫星的视线）


（图据：维基百科：Global Positioning System)

这就是为什么在没有信号的地方，手机仍能够显示出你的位置：它根本就没有使用无线通讯技术。这个系统也被设定得比较复杂，只能在有4个卫星同时看到你的情况下，系统才会指出你的位置。GPS卫星有一个大约12小时的轨道周期，每一天围绕地球转整整两圈。
（注：技术上来讲，是每一个恒星日绕地球两圈，也就是只有23小时56分钟，这取决于地球相对于恒星的旋转时间，而不是地球相对于太阳的。太抓狂了，也不知道为什么他们要用恒星日而不是用平常的时间，我就不用另外的17分钟来研究这个了，如果你们知道答案，请告诉我。而且，“恒星日”，就这个名词也很让人抓狂好吧。）

你们可以用谷歌地图来查看卫星的位置... ...（Google Earth Blog: Satellites) 


深度蓝框：太空垃圾

太空垃圾，是卫星界的业界毒瘤。轨道里除了那1265个活跃的卫星，还有上千个不活跃的卫星，而且还有一大堆之前任务中用完了的火箭。时不时的，里面一哥们儿就爆炸一个，或者是两个相撞，创造出无数个小碎片，这些就是太空垃圾。最近的十年内，太空垃圾数量急速增多，请看欧洲航天局做的模拟图：


(注：图片相对于地球夸大了碎片的体积）
（图据：University of California Research, Tumblr) 


大部分的卫星和碎片都聚在低地轨道上，最外面的那一圈是在地球同步轨道里。

全球的空间机构们追踪到了太空里大约1万7千多个碎片，其中只有7%是活跃的卫星。这是日前一张所有已知碎片的图解：


但更疯狂的是，他们只追踪到大的物质，也就是这幅图里显示的。小一点的碎片（1到10厘米）估计有15万到50万。而比两毫米大的物体，大概有超过百万。

碎片的问题就在于他们飞一般的速度（大部分近地轨道上的物体速度都达到了每小时1万7千米），与一个即使是很小的的物体相撞都可能对卫星或者航天飞船造成致命危害。一个一厘米的小东西，在这种速度下相撞，造成的危害不亚于一个小手榴弹（电影《地心引力》就很好的解释了这一点）。

超过三分之一的太空碎片来自于以下仅仅两个事件：
2007年中国的反卫星导弹试验。中国那年发射火箭击毁了报废的气象卫星，震惊全世界，造成3000多个新的太空碎片，大到可以被追踪到的那种。
而2009年美国和俄罗斯两国卫星相撞又撞出了2000多个碎片。(Loretta Hall, The History of Space Debris 2014) 

每一次的撞击都增加了更多太空碎片，而这些太空碎片又增加了撞出更多碎片的可能性，这有造成“多米诺骨牌效应”的危险，科学家们称之为“凯斯勒症候群”（Kessler Syndrome）。有很多机构都在试着减少近地轨道中的碎片量，像是捕获啦，镭射啦，拦截啦，等等等等。（感兴趣的朋友们可以参考以下链接：http://www.space.com/29271-space-station-laser-cannon-orbital-debris.html）


这里有一个图表，总结了各个国家的“太空足迹”，上面有现役卫星的数量，退役卫星的数量，以及每个国家造成的太空垃圾：


（图自：Michael Paukner)

在“向地面上的产业提供支持”这一原因里，还有有一些其他的太空活动着重于人类和太空的互动，像是太空采矿啦（planetaryresources.com），太空葬礼啦（celestis.com），当然还有太空旅游（virgingalactic.com），但至少到目前为止，卫星行业还是占了绝大部分。


原因二：观察和学习

在过去四十年来，这第二个和太空互动的原因，证明了即使停止向太空送人，我们也没有停止饥渴地学习和探索。天文学家们一直都在忙碌中，通过一篇又一篇的论文，破译着那本古老的推理小说：《我们在哪里？》

天文学家通过观察学到最多，而太空争霸赛的影响之一就是推动了科技发展，将观察太空的技术提升到另一个台阶。如下就是新时代天文学家观察太空的两个高科技方法：

＊观察和学习工具之一：太阳系中的航天探测器

基本上就是，科学家们将一个比较上档次的机器人对着某遥远的星球发射，月球啦，小行星啦，然后该机器人就在太空中飞行数月甚至是数年，开启无聊模式，直到最终到达目的地。最后根据计划，或是围绕着目的地拍照，捕获一些详细资料；或是着陆在目的地上，进行全方位观测。它每次一发现些什么，都会传回给我们。当有一天它的任务结束时，我们要不就是把别人撞在星星上杀掉，要不就是让他飞向太空深处消失。

我常常把我自己当成大家知道或不知道什么的测试纸。就像本网站以前提到过，我从三岁起就开始十分投入地和天文学约会了，所以说如果我不知道太空界里在发生些什么的话，我猜大家可能也不太知道吧。而说到航天探测器，我也曾经迷茫过。 外太空有200个吧？还是50个？9个？它们为什么在那里？谁发射的啊？它们在干嘛？我曾经知道的也就是一些时不时的新闻，一个什么什么号传回了了惊人的图片啊什么的。我一般会打开CNN网站里的相册，浏览一遍，激动，发给我另外三个也在和天文学约会的朋友，准备关上页面，同时还看到CNN那些专门吸引点击率的大标题文章，点进去一下，然后在接下来充满恨意的的三个小时里成功被摧毁生活下去的希望。这就是我和航天探测器的关系。

但在这篇文章的研究中，我很快就意识到并没有那么多需要了解的，也不需要太大的努力就可以把一切梳理好。以下就是我认为大家可以了解的八个重要航天探测器：

1）新地平线号
任务：冥王星
机构：NASA



（New Horizons，https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/main/index.html)


新地平线号最先，因为它刚刚完成了它伟大的一刻。2006年新地平线号发射，开始了长达10年的冥王星之旅（而且因为在2007年时与木星擦肩而过，它的速度被木星重力大大加快了）。新地平线号最终在2015年7月14日到达目的地。他没有登陆冥王星，却飞的很近，为我们发回历史上第一张冥王星的照片：



（Pluto:https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/global-mosaic-of-pluto-in-true-color）

（注：不知道大家有没有注意到，我们从来没见过冥王星长什么样，它太远也太小了，连我们最先进的望远镜都照不出一个体面的照片。在这张照片之前，很多看起来很清晰的照片其实都是艺术家的演绎。这一切都在7月14号那天改变了）（译者表示一直以为冥王星是蓝色的——译者）


接下来，新地平线号将会开启它新的旅程，飞向Kuiper belt（柯伊伯带），向我们发回彗星和一些矮行星的照片。你可以在这个链接里跟踪最新情报：http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/Mission/Where-is-New-Horizons/index.php 


不过比较尴尬的是，新地平线号发射的时候冥王星还是九大行星之一。近年来大家都在默默关注着冥王星的降级，以及避免与新地平线号的工作人员们眼神接触。尽管我也同样因为冥王星的降级而难过，但事实是，冥王星大概会因为不用再当太空名媛而感到高兴吧，像它的同胞，Kuiper belt 的矮行星 Eris (阋神星) 就一直默默无闻地生活着，直到2005年才被发现。 


2）好奇号
任务：火星
机构：NASA


(Curiosity, http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/index.html）


好奇号是目前最著名的火星漫游车。2012年，这个深受大家喜爱的，汽车大小的着陆机器人降落在了火星表面。好奇号的使命是寻找火星上是否曾有生命存在， 它去了一个巨大的火山坑里研究。 之前的两个火星漫游车，机遇号和勇气号都在2004年着陆于火星，开展了为期90个火星日的研究。两个机器人都挺过了原定服役期限，而且机遇号一直到现在都还在工作着。小哥们儿棒极了！

在火星附近还围绕着其他的一些探测器。但好奇号还是那里的一哥。

我在研究中发现了一个视频，它节选2006年的IMAX电影《漫游火星》：（百度可以下到该IMAX电影哦。——译者）




这个视频对我来说简直就是史上第一帅。
直到我发现另外这个将好奇号送上火星的视频，这简直就是帅炸：




3）朱诺号 
任务：木星
机构：NASA


(Juno,  http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/main/index.html) 

朱诺号在2011年就离开了地球，在太空转了一大圈回来，2013年时飞掠地球，得到重力助推。目前正驶向木星，预计会在2016年7月抵达。
（当朱诺号飞掠地球时，还拍到月球围绕着地球的视频，十分震撼：






一旦到达目的地，朱诺号就会环绕着木星，各种照相，并利用传感器探测那肥厚的云层里到底是什么。朱诺号任期结束后会摔死在木星上…希望在它落入木星烧毁前拍几张木星大气里的快照，这样人们还可以制作出一个“木星下行”的虚拟现实（Virtual Reality)。


4）卡西尼号
任务：土星
机构：NASA／欧洲航天局ESA／意大利航天局ASI


(Cassini, http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/overview/) 


1997年卡西尼号就驶向了土星，这位太阳系内唯一一个觉得穿蓬蓬裙很ok的星球。卡西尼号于2004年到达土星，它是历史上第一个环绕土星的航天探测器，常常送回来一些让你吓掉大牙的照片，比如：



以及：



还有这张，离环近一些：



以及这张魔幻帅图，当时太阳正在土星后面：


（以上四张图据NASA: http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov)

2005年，卡西尼号降下了它的着陆器，名叫惠更斯号（Huygens)。它着陆在土星最大的“月球”上：泰坦星（Titan, 也称土卫六）。这里有一张惠更斯号在土卫六上照下的真实照片。（见到那么遥远的行星表面，有点诡异...）


(图据：维基百科：Titan(moon)）


5）和6）旅行者1号和旅行者2号 
任务：木星、土星、天王星、海王星
机构：NASA



（Voyager, http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/)


旅行者号姐妹探测器发射于1977年，这两位探测器是历史上第一对收集太阳系外围四个巨星图片的探测器。旅行者2号仍是唯一一个拜访过天王星和海王星的探测器，并分别照下了这些可怕的照片：


(NASA: http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/uranus/galleries)

旅行者号们的帅气就表现在，尽管使命早已达成，它们还在向外行驶着。现在它们俩都离地球很无节操的远，而且速度极快。旅行者一号是最快的，速度达到每小时38000英里（每小时61000公里）。这种速度快到飞越大西洋只需要5分钟。它是历史上离地球最远的人造物体，现在离咱们131个天文单位（Astronomical Unit，AU, 一天文单位就是，呵呵，地球到太阳的距离，大概9千3百万英里，也就是1亿5千万公里）。它也是首个飞离太阳系的人造物体。在目前这个速度下，旅行者1号将会到达比邻星（Proxima Centauri），除太阳外离我们最近的一颗恒星 ，嗯，会在7万3千年内到达。

旅行者号们的另一帅气就表现在，在发射之前，一个由Carl Sagan带领的NASA工作组给两姐妹分别装上了时间胶囊（详情可以看：http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/goldenrec.html）里面包含了很多符号、声音以及地球的图像（还有一个播放多媒体的符号说明书）。
所以两位航天探测器某天就可以告诉外星人我们到底在搞些什么。也可能完全就是浪费时间。不过，who knows～

7）罗塞塔号
任务：彗星
机构：欧洲航天局ESA


（Rosetta, http://rosetta.esa.int)


罗塞塔号在2004年发射升空，去年备受关注：2014年8月它到达了代号为67P的彗星， 并在几个月后成功投下它的小着陆器，Philae （菲莱）。67P彗星最后被研究出来是一块蛮大的石头（2.7英里／4.3公里长），不过罗塞塔号拍的图片还是满酷炫的：


（http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/03/20/science/space/rosetta-comet-photos.html?_r=1）



8）黎明号 
任务：灶神星Vesta、谷神星Ceres
机构：NASA


(Dawn, http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov)


黎明号根本就没想到它会上榜。我不确定大家是否知道，在小行星带（Asteroid belt ）上有很多巨型的，普通行星般大小的天体。小行星带是一个有着成千上万小行星的巨环，位于火星和木星轨道之间（注：不同于环绕外太阳系的柯伊伯带），包含着超过75万个直径至少有1千米的小行星。身在其中的谷神星Ceres, 是一个直径为月亮27%的矮行星，重量占小行星带总重的三分之一。而灶神星Vesta，小行星带第二大，也是里面最亮的天体。我以前还没有把他们当回事儿过。总之，黎明号在2007年发射了，在2011年围着灶神星运行了9个月，并在2015年3月到达谷神星（历史上第一个环绕两个不同天体的探测器）。


除了以上这些外，太空里还有不少其他的探测器。比如信使号（Messenger)，一直在水星轨道上运行达7年之久，直到2015年4月自行撞击在水星上；拂晓号（Akatsuki)，日本的探测器，本应在2010年到达金星轨道，但是搞砸了，今年准备重来；还有一些比较太平无事的探测器在月球轨道上运行，像中国的嫦娥三号，它在月球上投下了自1976年以来的首个着陆器。还有其他一系列的太阳探测器。这有一张图表显示了所有过去和现在的航天探测器，并配上了好看的图像解说（可点击查看大图）：

＊观察和学习工具之二：太空望远镜


望远镜从17世纪就出现了，在接下来的400年里，它们变得越来越强大，成为了人类破译《我们在哪里？》的最主要工具。

但无论望远镜发展的多么先进，它们仍然会因为地面上的因素发挥有限。大家都知道，通过一杯水看光线时，它会傻傻地变弯吧？星星们眨眼也是这个道理，只不过我们不是透过水，而是透过地球的大气来看星星。大气层虽然不像水那样将光线变得那么弯，但行星们和星系对我们来说都只是一个小小的点，因此任何程度的模糊都会变成一个大问题——就像在泳池的水底研究天空中的飞鸟群一样。

在1960年，人类得到了将望远镜送进太空的新技能，在那里，望远镜可以向世人展示史上最水晶般剔透的视野。1990年，NASA发射了地球上第一个最牛逼的太空望远镜：哈勃望远镜。

（注：尴尬的是，在近乎20年的经费大战和修建之后，在冒着风险跨越重重阻碍最终用航天飞机将哈勃望远镜送入轨道后，NASA收到了它传来的第一批照片，不过，他们是模糊的... 原来反射镜的曲率偏差了2.2千分之一毫米。一个几乎察觉不到的错误，但在那样遥远的距离，要将望远镜取回来，基本上就毁了之前铺好的一切。于是乎一直到四年之后，另一架航天飞机才送人上去修好它。维修过程必须在地球上就排练到完美那种，宇航员也必须在太空一次将它修好。反射镜精准的要命，如果一名宇航员不小心摩擦到了它，整个望远镜就完了。不过幸运的是，自1994年以来，哈勃都完美无瑕地工作着。）

这个重达13吨，校车长度的太空望远镜，有着一个7.9英尺（2.4米）长的镜头，它精确到能用激光照射到200英里（322公里）外的一颗硬币，强大到可以在波士顿的房间里看到住在东京的一只萤火虫（如果地球是平的）。而该望远镜正在340英里（547公里）高的轨道上，那里没有任何大气或光污染，它的状态正是NASA口中的“终极顶峰（NASA)”。这些都让哈勃拥有着史无前例的宇宙视野，能够在过去的25年里向我们传回美得丧病的图片，简直就是梦幻。就像这个经典的星系：


（http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/multimedia/index.html）


以及这两个星系，它们正在缓慢融合中：





以及这个不可思议的“创生之柱”（Pillars of Creation )（最左边的手指很大，从头到尾有四光年。也就是说如果你坐着飞机从指根飞到指尖，大概会花450万年呵呵哒）




以及这种情况，当哈勃将他的镜头对准天空里一个似乎空着的一小块时（一小块的尺寸和月亮尺寸对比）：





发现了成千上万的星系：




哈勃和其他太空望远镜们通过他们的视野，向世人展示了一个全新的世界，告诉大家我们在哪里，我们又是如何来到这里的。它们一遍又一遍刷新着我们的知识，无论是从暗能量到宇宙的起源，还是从太空的年龄和size到类地行星的数量。
（哈勃望远镜预计在2020年退役。自2009年系统出错以来，还没有人上去将它修好，这也是不可避免的嘛。它的航行速度在慢慢衰退，大概在2030-2040之间，哈勃就将在地球大气中烧毁。也是蛮难过的，本来最初的计划是让一个航天飞机去把它接回来，这样它还可以在Smithsonian博物馆里当个名媛。但航天飞行任务终止了，哈勃也只能凄惨的去了....不过，好消息就是，哈勃有一个无敌继任者：詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜（James Webb Space Telescope，JWST），预计2018年到达地球轨道。而且，它的能力是哈勃最嗨时期的10－100倍）


在过去的40年里，这两个目标：“向地面上的产业提供帮助”以及“观察和学习”，就是我们与太空关系的全部。

而成功达成这两个目标的都是航天机器们。人类和太空的故事最近几章节也都是关于各种航天机，人类的戏份一般都在地球或是临近地球上：控制操控杆。

自从阿波罗17号1972年返回地球后，人类上太空的唯一原因就是：机器没有办法完成一些特定的任务，需要送人上去。在进入太空的大概550人中，有400位基本都是在后太空争霸赛时代进的太空。自阿波罗以来，人们变得实际了，科学家和技术师去太空都是为了工作。这就是为什么在过去40年，每一架载人航天飞机都只在地球附近一层薄薄的空间——近地轨道里面玩。



国际空间站


现在，几乎每一架载人航天器的使命都是去国际空间站里（International Space Station, ISS)接送宇航员。





国际空间站由16个国家参与建设。1998年开始动工，修建了超过十年。空间站在近地轨道的最低一带活动，高度在205到255英里（330到410公里）（一直在公里和英里间转换我也是醉了。有58%的读者来自美国，英里倒没什么，但有42%的读者都来自世界各地，大家没有英里的概念啊。美帝你也敢起用这么SB的计量系统，也不给个理由），这个高度大概有冰岛那么长，夜晚大家肉眼就可以看到。
空间站其实比人们想象中大，大概有320辆汽车那么重，有美式橄榄球场那么宽。


（https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/onthestation/facts_and_figures.html



国际空间站到底是拿来干什么的篮框


写这篇文章前，我是真不知道空间站是用来做什么的，也不知道大家在里面干什么。每次看ISS视频，都是一些大人在里面飘着玩。


幸好，上上个月在波士顿举行了一个国际空间站大会。是由美国空间科学发展中心（Center for the Advancement of Science in Space，CASIS)举办，他们负责着国际空间站里美国的部分。我在这项会议里学到了：


＊国际空间站是一个科学实验室。有点像一般的实验室，只不过是飘在太空那种，大家可以在零重力下进行实验（也不是绝对的零重力，是那种微重力，microgravity，等一下会向大家解释）。


＊总的来说，空间站的实验都是为了获得零重力条件。但除此之外，还有很多其他的目的：从研究骨质疏松症，比如宇航员的骨质萎缩（因为他们不用对抗重力），到测试设备如何承受太空环境；从研究液体的无重状态、怎样受外力影响，到利用重力的变化去引诱细菌们展现出如何让基因对特定药物免疫。


＊国际空间站的宇航员们每周都有十分紧凑的时间表。总的来说，他们不是在睡觉（8.5小时）、吃饭（早餐和晚餐1.5小时，午餐1小时）、锻炼（每天强制2.5小时），就是在做实验（每天9小时）。我还给三位宇航员的时间表照了一张相：

（两位俄罗斯宇航员，一位美国宇航员。美国的那位是有名的双胞胎宇航员之一Scott Kelly,他哥哥Mark Kelly是美国国会议员Gabrielle Giffords的老公。你可以通过这个网站查看空间站里的宇航员人数：http://www.howmanypeopleareinspacerightnow.com）

宇航员们周末放假，不过也没有那么好玩，大概就在舱内四处飘一飘，看看窗外卖萌。 


＊我不是唯一一个热切想要去国际空间站玩的人。要被NASA选上会经历激烈的竞争。在成千上万个申请人中，只有100名会进入最后的面试和身体素质测试，而最终只有1到2人可以上。极少数情况下，私人公司或者个人可以在空间站上买下一个位子，花费是6千万美元。



如果你想感受生活在空间站是怎样的，这里有一个视频。（微信只能贴三个视频。感兴趣的童鞋，可以优酷搜“[拍客]美国女宇航员带你了解国际空间站内部”，第一个——译者）



到目前为止，有15个国家的216名宇航员都去空间站玩过了：







如何将东西送上太空

好叻，现在太空里有些什么我们大概都清楚了，但它们是怎样进入太空的呢？大家有没有想过，像GPS卫星这种东西刚开始是怎么上去的？答案就是，现在有9个国家都可以把物体送到轨道上：俄罗斯，美国，法国，日本，中国，印度，以色列，伊朗，和朝鲜，还有一个非国家性组织，欧洲宇航局。如果一个卫星上天了，那是因为有人给以上10个大哥里的某个大哥付了钱，他们才可以把该卫星放在一个巨贵的火箭上。（也有因为自己国家需要而发射卫星的）

而要将人送上太空，历史上只有三个国家做到了：俄罗斯，美国和中国（一个在太空领域里急速发展的新秀）。从60年代开始，俄罗斯就开始用他的Soyuz号将人送上太空，而美国在1972年结束了阿波罗项目之后，于1981年重新使用了航天飞机项目（Space Shuttle Program) 将人送上天。


（http://www.howitworksdaily.com/vostok-3ka-up-close/）

在接下来的30年里，美国发射了135个航天飞机到近地轨道上，其中133个都成功了。其中两次意外是美国历史上令人心痛的一章：1986年的挑战者号和2003年的哥伦比亚号。

航天飞机项目终止于2011年。现在只有两个国家可以将人类送上太空：俄罗斯和中国。而作为曾经在世人瞩目下成功将人类送上月球的美国，现在只能借用俄罗斯的火箭送宇航员上国际空间站，还要看俄罗斯的脸色。



___________

所以呢，人类和太空的故事就是这样的。还蛮诡异的。1970年，这个故事是：




故事本来应该按这种节奏发展：




但到了现在的2016年，剧情却是这样的：

当我回顾着人类和太空的剧情时，我的心情应该是嗨的。仅在苏联第一次将人造物体送上轨道的58年后，我们现在就拥有了各种环绕地球运行的高科技设备，在观测和通讯方面都获得了神奇的力量。太空里还有一队队机器信使遍布太阳系，不断向我们传回它们的发现。地球上空还有一个巨型望远镜，告诉着我们宇宙的真实模样。我们头上250英里的地方还有一个搭载着真人的，橄榄球场般大小的科学实验室，

这些都很牛啊。


要是剧情是这样发展的话：


我应该会觉得现在发生的简直都是奇迹。

不过不幸的是，60年代发生了，你们懂的。于是画面就成了这样：














出色的魔术表演都会遵循一个简单的道理：循序渐进。如果你不能抓住观众日渐厌倦的心，他们很快就会抛弃你。

人类和太空的魔术表演在某些领域一直处在进步模式，例如，在对太空的求知和了解过程中，我们不停地战胜自己，每隔十年对太空的理解都会上一个显著的新台阶。人类的探索精神从未中断过，自阿波罗以来，一直都在无尽的太空中茁壮成长着。

但我们有多惊讶于所发现的东西，就有多厌倦深藏在《我们在哪里？》背后的答案。探索发现带给了我们激动，鼓舞，和肾上腺素，却没有点亮冒险的明灯。航天探测器和望远镜可能会让我们大开眼界，满足我们的好奇心，但却不能像目睹自己的物种进入从未有人到达过的领域一样，触发我们内在的动物野性。在这一方面，过去的40年让我们感到空虚。在看惯了人类登月之后，穿梭在国际空间站的各种载人项目就像Ross Andersen（美国《大西洋月刊》资深编辑）说的那样：“如目睹哥伦布在家门口的地中海里航行那样兴奋。”

这就是为什么在今天的世界，人类和太空的故事已渐渐驶出了人们的脑海。那些本应让我们激动得下跪的大事件也变成了屌丝小故事。随便问问你认识的10个受过良好教育的人，看他们是否知道太阳系的太空探测器，国际空间站，NASA, 或是SpaceX，大部分人可能都不太了解。有的人甚至不知道现在还在有人进入太空。因为大家根本就不care了。因为上场的顺序，人类和太空的故事有点令人失望。这种情况下，凭直觉预测太空故事的下一章，大概会像这样吧：



很多人会认为这并不是坏事。他们会问：“现在地球上已经有那么多问题了，为什么还要花那么多钱送人去遥远的太空？”。麻省议员Barney Frank，30年来在美国预算决策方面扮演着关键角色，对于野心勃勃的载人航天旅行，他认为那“顶多就是一种国家不易沉迷于其中的奢侈行为”以及“完全就是在浪费钱”以及“简直就是无聊”。于是自太空争霸赛以来，NASA的经费大幅削减。说明不仅仅是Frank一名政府官员持这样的看法。


乍一看，Frank的说法完全是有理的。毕竟面对医保，国家安全，教育和贫困这些种种问题，我们真的应该去容纳“探险经费”吗？在这种节奏下，人类和太空的故事似乎最有可能像上图那样发展。


我用了过去两个月的时间不断的阅读，讨论和思考这个故事未来的发展情况，现在我对未来的看法完完全全的改变了。



我认为我们都在等待一个巨大的惊喜。


第二部分：Musk的使命

和其他所有人一样，Elon Musk有很多人生目标。和其他所有人不一样的是，他的人生目标之一是将一百万人送上火星。
在过去的几个月中，每次和朋友解释我在怎样创作这一系列的文章时，只要我一提到火星，一切就都变了。朋友们的面部表情从“神马？？不可能！！”到“哎，我以为Elon Musk很棒的，没想到他只是个愚蠢的土豪罢了”到“我可以笑吗哈哈哈，难道Tim是认真的吗，他会生气？”

唯独没有得到过这样的回应：“太棒了，这真的可行。”

我完全理解——因为其实之前我和朋友们的想法是一样一样的，直到最近。通常一个句子如果包含了火星两个字，那这句话不是在讲深奥的天文学，就是一个炫酷的科幻小说。而征服这个词通常出现在历史叙述中。这两个词不可能一起用来描述现实世界。

为了解释马斯克为什么要将一百万人送上火星，我要先向大家介绍两位外星人，他们生活一个位于银河的另一边的类地行星上——Zurple和Quignee：

Zurple和Quignee的星球，Uvuvuwu，比地球晚形成12亿年，但是由于Uvuvuwu星球上的低等单细胞有机生物进化成复杂的多细胞有机生物只用了3亿年（地球上这一过程用了16亿年），Uvuvuwu星球上的生命完爆我们，早在1100万年前就达到了人类的智力水平。如今，Uvuvuwu上生物的发达水平远非我们地球人所能想象。

240万年前Zurple和Quignee在研究生院见面时就成为了朋友，他们最喜欢的活动之一是观察银河系中出现智慧生命，下赌注这些生命会灭绝还是会“通关”（凭借我们所不能理解的先进技术，他们可以实时看到所有行星）。

最近，Zurple和Quignee被143-Snoogie行星——这是他们对地球的称呼——上面发生的事情所吸引。早在35万年前他们就对143-Snoogie产生了兴趣，当时Zurple的IntelligenceWatch App上面收到了这样一条告警：

143-Snoogie上面的生命已达到了致命的智力水平。

他那时正和Quignee共进午餐，说起这个告警时，Quignee说：“我赌百分之二百他们会灭绝。”Zurple接受了赌约。为什么不呢？观察追踪一组物种并在他们身上下赌注，这事一直其乐无穷。

但是最近，从100年前开始，这两个外星人对143-Snoogie上的生命形式观察更入微了，直到今天，他们已经痴迷于这个星球上发生的一切。

为了弄清楚原因，我们来思考一下他们的赌约，到底什么会让他们分出胜负。Quignee想要人类灭绝。想得牙根痒痒。Zurple希望人类“通关”，无论通关是什么意思。我们会再回到这里。
有一件事情他们可能已经在留意了，就是143-Snoogie星球生命史上灭绝事件的规律。我们来看一下。


宇宙的可怕之处

物种灭绝和人类的死亡有共通之处——总是以平缓的速度时不时地发生。而大规模的物种灭绝事件，就像战争或者席卷人类的流行病一样——是一举毁灭绝大部分人口的罕有事件。人类从未经历过大规模灭绝事件，这样的事件一旦发生，结果便极有可能是人类灭亡——或者事件本身会毁灭人类（比如一个足够大的小行星撞击），或者是事件造成的后果（比如造成食物供应大大减少，气温急剧变化，或者大气成分变异）会终结人类。下图展示了历史长河中的动物灭绝事件（用了海洋灭绝来做纵轴比较）。我标记了五次主要的灭绝事件以及每次物种灭绝的百分比（这张图没有包含很多人认为人类自作孽导致正在发生的新大规模灭绝事件）。


（图据：Wikipedia Commons: File: Extinction intensity.svg)


自然发生的灭绝事件可能由多种因素造成。苍茫宇宙，危机四伏，而我们只是茫茫之中脆弱的有机体，要在一系列条件的微妙平衡中才能生存。我们存活至今，只是因为迄今为止宇宙允许我们的存在。一些可能会摧毁我们的事情：

近距离的超新星爆发。超新星爆发，是宇宙中最大规模的爆发，巨型星毁灭时会发生。如果超新星爆发出现在距地球30光年以内——这样的爆炸约每隔25000万年发生一次——那就可能成为我们的末日。

伽马射线爆发。伽马射线爆发是宇宙中亮度最高的事件。当大质量恒星的内核融合为越来越重的元素以至于最后无法再融合时，恒星会崩溃成为黑洞，喷射出双向射线，几秒钟放射出的能量就等同于太阳终其100亿年的一生所释放的能量，难以置信。伽马射线爆发比超新星爆发罕见得多，每个星系每百万年只有几次，但是不同于超新星爆发（在我们这样的星系中每个世纪大概会有两次超新星爆发），伽马射线爆发从很远的距离就可以极大程度地毁灭我们，从我们星系中的任何位置都可以——如果射线刚好朝向我们的方向。根据假设，上图五次大规模灭绝中的第一次可能就是由伽马射线爆发造成的。

超级太阳耀斑。太阳耀斑一直存在，是地球的磁场保护着我们不受其侵害（这就是北极光的产生），但是我们观察到其他类日恒星会有偶尔的超级耀斑，比正常的太阳耀斑威力强大几百万倍。如果我们的太阳也出现超级耀斑就完了。提到地球的磁场——

地球磁场两极反转。如果地球磁场想要吸引眼球，反转随时可能发生——平均约每百万年发生两次。两极反转本身并不是问题——但是转变过程极具危险。磁场反转的过程会持续100至1000年，期间磁场力量减弱到大约只有正常值的5%。因为我们依赖于地球磁场的保护才免受伤害，这对生命来说就是灾难性的。科学家们已经演示了磁场反转和大规模灭绝事件之间的关联 (http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2014/06/10/earths-magnetic-flips-may-triggered-mass-extinctions/#.Vrq7W8e9qu5)。

流氓黑洞。时不时地，这些无赖就会不请自来地溜进太阳系，带来一场浩劫。即使不靠近地球，哪怕在距地球10亿英里处经过，都会把地球轨道甩得更加近似椭圆，导致夏季气温升至150F（60C），冬季气温降至-50F（-45C）。这还怎么活。

混账外星人。让我请已故物理学家Gerard O’Neill来总结一下：“先进的西方文明对所有与其有接触的原始文明都是毁灭性的，尽管每次接触都是试图保护或护卫这一原始文明。我有充足的理由相信同样的事情也会发生在我们身上。”

全球性的流行病。没有好莱坞式结局的流行病爆发。

小行星。额。关于子弹要说的太多了，来个蓝框：

令人不快的小行星效应蓝框
太阳系中各个角落都有四处漫游的小行星和彗星，从鹅卵石大小到矮行星大小，但大多都分布在三个区域——1）火星轨道和木星轨道之间的小行星带（本来可以凝聚成为自有行星但由于附近木星的万有引力没有成功），2）海王星轨道周边的柯伊伯带，这个大得多，和3）太阳系周边的巨型球体奥尔特云，这个大得多得多。

星球大小快速入门：如果太阳系是一便士大小（直径=2cm），海王星这个小针孔在便士边缘环绕（地球的整个轨道小似中心的一个小点），小行星带就是用削尖了的铅笔在便士中心画的直径大约2毫米的小小的圈。彗星带则是便士外围的一个扁平的圆圈（就像土星的环），厚度就如你用指尖画出的。不像小行星带和彗星带都是光盘形，奥尔特云是一个球体，从距便士大约30厘米（1英尺）的位置向四周各个方向延伸，外延30米（100英尺），比地球二号太空船（Spaceship Earth.2）还要大一些。以便士为起点，最近的恒星在90米（295英尺）远——将近三倍便士到奥尔特云外围的距离。假设太阳系便士在足球场的一边端区，最近的恒星就是在另一端区的一个针孔，而旅行者1号，运动速度最快的人造物体，如今已经连续38年嗖嗖地驶离地球，现在离便士也只有4厘米远——它已经成为史上最远的人造物体了。我得让自己停下来再回到文章上面去，但这有点难度因为天马行空写出这段太享受了。

好了，回到小行星。
因为碰撞或者一些重力干扰（可能来自木星或者某个路过的恒星），小行星或彗星（后面行文我就仅用“小行星”来指代这二者了）会被推移出正常轨道，我们就有可能被这类小行星撞击。



小行星并不需要多大体积就足以摧毁一切。1908年，一个很小的，60米的小行星在西伯利亚3-6英里（5-10千米）的上空发生爆炸。即便从那么高的地方，它还夷平了8000万棵树。如果它在地球表面爆炸，那威力可相当于超过1000个广岛原子弹。一个直径只有半英里（0.8千米）的小行星爆炸在空气中扬起的尘雾足以让地球的气温持续几年降低几度，进而引发各种意想不到的后果。1989年，一个这样大小的小行星就在地球六个小时前所在的位置，穿过了地球的轨道。更大的小行星撞击结果会怎样呢？来看一下，注意在木星身上留下这些撞击痕迹的小行星约和地球差不多大小：

(图据：维基百科：Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9)

那颗让恐龙伤心欲绝而遗臭万年的小行星直径大约6英里（10千米）。如果被上述任一小行星撞击，后果首先将是撞击区域附近比太阳表面温度还要高10倍的滚滚灼热，小行星则以100倍子弹的速度自天而降，空气都将来不及躲闪被压在下面。紧接着几乎瞬时地，冲击波会向四周各个方向扩张，将方圆数百英里夷为平地。到此时，爆炸威力将超过十亿个广岛原子弹，成百上千的立方千米大的石块已经从小行星和爆炸地飞升出去，形成一座高耸入云的黑墙，不可逾越。当所有这些石块雨再由空中落下时，又会变成数以千计的巨大火球，将整个地球的城市和森林变成一片火海。很快，整个地球都会变得灼热炙手，接下来是一连串的地震，火山爆发，前所未有的飓风海啸猛烈地冲击每个海岸。再然后，尘土烟雾将笼罩全球，让人经年累月不得重见天日，地球急剧降温——千年之后地球的气候都无法回复如初。

假设地球是一栋三楼小别墅大小，所有这一切的罪魁祸首就是一粒豆子大小东西的撞击。



地球本身并不会因撞击而受多大影响——但地球表面脆弱的生存条件将会天翻地覆。这里有一个视频描绘的就是我刚刚讲述的这些事情，很压抑。


更加恐怖的是，小行星在太空中几乎是不可见的，很难发现。太空研究机构和业余天文学爱好者确实在追踪一些有潜在威胁的小行星，但多数情况下，在小行星从天空翻滚而下之前，我们根本没办法知道它要造访地球。


所以，尽管我们生活的宇宙和地球看似安稳宁静，实际上更像一个暂时平静的森林——冷不丁地，就会从树丛中蹿出一个狰狞的嗜血食肉兽，然后绝大部分生命都将遭到荼毒蹂躏，甚至绝迹。上面的大规模灭绝事件图讲述的是发生在过去的五个恐怖故事，都是安安静静的地球突然变成了当时所有生物难以言喻的噩梦。这是会再次发生的——就在这里，在你坐的地方。唯一不确定的问题是什么时候会再次发生。

我们来看一下6亿年的动物史以及期间的大规模灭绝事件：


这条时间线上，我们看到虽然未来在劫难逃，但是这里的时间尺度是极其大的，所以在近期发生毁灭性的自然灾难危及人类存亡，这种可能性还是很低的。多低呢？

来梳理一下头绪，我们先假设未来5000万年中有很大可能发生大规模灭绝事件，也就是说，有50000分之一的可能性在未来1000年内发生。按发生概率计算，这就相当于有人在地上画个X告诉你未来一个月内会有闪电刚好击中这一位置。一个月的50000分之一大约是一分钟，那么接下来一分钟内闪电击中X位置的概率就和地球在下一个千年遭遇大规模灭绝事件的可能性一样。换句话说，确知闪电会在这个月内某个时间点击中X位置的情况下，下一个千年继续生活在地球上的安全感，应该就像下一分钟站在X位置一样。

如果在闪电的例子中，一千年是一分钟，那么人的一生大约就是五秒钟。所以问题就变成，如果你站到X点上五秒钟会感觉如何？反正我无论在X点站多长时间都不会心潮澎湃，那五秒钟可能确实有少许压力——但我也明白自己几乎是绝对安全的。这就是我们有生之年活在地球上应有的感觉——至少在涉及生死存亡的自然灾难方面是。

如果你只在乎自己的生命，或者只是自己后裔的十代生命，那存活于地球绝非难事。

但如果你关心的是人类这个物种，就要换种方式思考了。如果人类作为一个物种永远滞留于地球上，那就像一个人打算在X点直挺挺地站上好几个月。上面的灭绝图告诉我们，闪电大概每两个月会击中X点，所以这绝不是一个很好的长期计划——不对吗？或许先进的科技可以帮助我们在几次迎面而来的闪电中幸免于难，但这可不是什么让人愉快的经历，而且每次闪电都可能将我们一击毙命。

我们再换种方式来看。想象地球是一个硬盘，地球上的每个物种，包括我们，都是硬盘上面的一个Microsoft Excel文件，充斥着数万亿行的数据。用我们缩短了的时间尺度，5000万年=1个月，那么：

现在，是2015年8月
硬盘（也就是地球）形成于7.5年前，在2008年初
一年前，2014年8月，硬盘存储了Excel文件（即动物的起源）。从那时起，新的Excel文件就在不断地生成，有的文件出现了错误信息已经无法再打开（即灭亡）。
自从2014年8月，硬盘已经崩溃了五次——即灭绝事件——分别是在2014年11月，2014年12月，2015年3月，2015年4月和2015年7月。每次硬盘崩溃后，都会在几小时后重启，但重启后都会有大约70%的Excel文件消失。除了2015年3月那次崩溃，那次有95% 的文件损毁。
现在是2015年8月中旬，智慧人类的Excel文件刚刚生成约两个小时。

问题来了——假设你有一个硬盘上面储存着极其重要的Excel文件，而且你知道这个硬盘特别靠谱地每隔一两个月就会崩溃一次，最近一次发生在五个星期之前——显而易见你应该做什么？

你肯定会把文件复制到第二块硬盘上。

这就是为什么Musk想送一百万人到火星上去。

为什么是一百万人？一百万是Musk粗略估计出的人类要做到完全自给自足所需的最小人数。这里对自给自足的定义很简单——就是指如果地球毁灭，火星上的人口可以继续生存繁衍壮大下去。他们不能在任何方面依赖地球。需要挖矿？火星上的人口中要有人懂得如何开矿，要有矿工工作。需要建个新的医院？要发射火箭去维修坏掉的网络卫星？要扩大农业生产以解决食物短缺？由于战争爆发要采取紧急措施？火星上的人口需要自己解决所有这些难题。Musk认为一万人或十万人没办法做到——但一百万应该够了。

这个概念——让人类生命自给自足地存活于多个行星——通常被称为“行星冗余”。Musk把它称作物种的生命保险。我把它叫作硬盘备份。

当然，火星硬盘并不比地球硬盘可靠。它和地球一样，也会面临很多同样的灾难，它也会每一两个月崩溃一次。但通常情况下，两个硬盘不会同时崩溃。如果其中一个硬盘真的损毁严重，导致我们在上面的Excel文件全部丢失，那另外一个硬盘也会继续存在一段时间——这段时间大概足以再去做一个新的备份。

所以现在你把珍贵的Excel文件放在了两个硬盘上。感觉应该好多了。但如果文档对你来说真的万分宝贵，那仅仅把它们放在两块硬盘上或许并不能让你高枕无忧。你大概希望再多复制几份到其他硬盘上。但是我们有其他选择吗？正好再来个蓝框：

哪些行星听上去适合生存？
我们一个一个来看。

水星

水星时运不济成了离太阳最近的行星，
(图据：维基百科：Mercury (planet) )
就像在一张桌子旁入座时，坐在了一个450磅重、面露凶相的好色男身边。
如果你身处水星，那白天就要在800F（430C）的天气中度过——这个温度下，如果你朝地上扔一大块铅，它会融化成一团泥浆。水星上几乎没有大气层，所以除了要忍受炙烤，你还会站在真空中，肺里的空气瞬时会被挤压而空，皮肤中的水分也开始蒸发。没有大气层还意味着你要遭受太阳辐射的剧毒（天空看起来就像是地球上天空的2.5倍那么大）。这还没完，水星的引力只相当于地球引力的38%，所以你可以在立刻死去的同时试试随意地跳来跳去。到此为止，你一定很担心夜晚的降临，听到水星的日夜循环是58个地球日你肯定会更加愁容满面。

一个月后，当夜晚终于来临，你欣喜若狂，但一分钟后你发现气温骤降到了-280F（-170C），这个温度比地球历史上所记载的最低气温（南极沃斯托克站）还低152F。因为水星没有大气层，不能保留一丁点儿太阳的热量，也无法散布热量到行星各处。并且你还是得痛苦地站在真空中。在严寒中冰冻一整个月，然后再在日出时烤焦。

你在水星最大的赌注是极点附近，那里虽然寒冷长期黑暗，但至少有冰，你可以保持水分。理论上可以在那里建设人类基地，但胜算太小。

我问起Musk水星的时候，他把它称作“地狱之洞”，关于水星的谈话就再也没能进行下去。

金星

金星的恶劣无人能出其右，

（图据：维基百科：Venus）
跟金星相比，在水星生存简直就是逍遥地坐在毛伊岛的海滩吃烤虾。

金星的大气层是另一个极端——浓密得不可思议——跟这比起来，真空反而让人觉得可爱。金星之旅将会是这样的：

首先，空气中96%是二氧化碳，剧毒，无法呼吸。

其次，如果你瞬间就会被超过地球表面90倍大气压强的大气层压扁，谁还在乎空气是否可以呼吸。这个压力相当于你在海面一千米以下感受到的压力——比有记载的器械潜水深三倍。即使你莫名其妙地可以保持直立，在这样的大气压强下移动一下手臂也会感觉像在深水中一般艰难。

再次，如果得知金星气温870华氏度（465C）谁还在乎前面两项。想象将烤箱加热到铅的熔点，然后再将温度升高138度——金星整个星球都是这个温度。到了晚上（这里的晚上也不会轻易到来——金星的白天比它的一年还长），金星的气温完全维持不变，因为它厚实的大气层保留了全部热量。

在白天，你会在微光中经历这一切，头顶橙红色的云层。太阳看上去只是天空中朦胧的，稍微明亮呈现黄色的那部分。在晚上，就成了漆黑一片，没有星光——但大气层的高压还在，熔炉般的高温也还在。至少那里不会有虫子。

鉴于我以上所说，苏联探测器金星13号的降落真得让我刮目相看，金星13号在1982年一路降落到金星表面并且存活了127分钟——这个时间够长了，期间拍下了这两张照片，也是人类仅有的金星表面的照片：


(https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/1e04ud/surface_of_venus_pic/)

在金星表面不会有风的问题，你只会感觉到轻轻的微风——但如果你顺着大气层向上走，马上又是另一番景象。金星的高空大气层是一种新的地狱——持续不断的狂风，风速是地球上威力最大的飓风的两倍，夹着一滴滴的硫磺酸（用来疏通排水管道的那种酸），嗖嗖地打到你的脸上。典型的金星。

然而，假设你诡异地最终穿越了金星让人痛不欲生的大气层到达了大气层顶部，迎接你的将是——简直不可思议——怡人又宜居的生存条件。在金星的云层顶部很随机地分布着一层和地球上的气温及压力都相近的云层，而且因为氧气和氮气都从金星浓密的大气层中升腾起来（就像地球上升起的氦气），这里的空气或许可以呼吸。事实上一些科学家已经认真讨论起人类征服金星的高层大气，建造“漂浮在金星大气层中海拔50千米上空的城市”。

我问起Musk金星的时候，我很惊讶听到他暗示如果要去这个行星生存，还是有可能的，只是“困难重重又重重”。他说随着时代发展，科技进步，或许有办法清理掉金星的大部分大气层，或许它可以作为人类在遥远未来的殖民选择。

火星

如果火星是地球上的某个地方，一定没有人想去那里。

(http://space-facts.com/mars/)
但如果说要移居到地球以外的星球，在其他所有星球都恶劣如梦魇的情况下，移居火星听上去还是很值得考虑的。简单来说，火星就是更冷一些的南极，看上去像亚利桑那州的沙漠，上面的空气无法呼吸，上面的太阳如果长时间暴露其下会被辐射致死。火星在任何方面都比地球上条件最差最不宜居的地方更恶劣。但如果要建个人造“居住嚢”，建个小小的温室花园，一个不错的太空舱，火星上的条件还是绰绰有余的，事实上你是可以在火星上存活的。火星上面甚至还有水——而且很多——封存在极点的冰层中，如果你在一年中合适的时间出现在火星正确的地点，还可以享受到70F（21C）的舒适温度。或者，当你透过居住嚢的窗户向外观望时，至少知道外面天气还不错。

火星的一天（一个“太阳日”）大约是24.5小时，这无论是对人类还是对植物来说都很适宜。而且火星重力大约是地球重力的38%，这个重力条件下，你基本可以正常运行。甚至还可以享受低重力条件下的乐趣，比如可以跳起来轻轻松松灌个15英尺的篮筐，或者住在二楼，早上直接跳出窗户去上班（粗略来讲，三分之一的重力作用就意味着，在地球上从X英尺高的悬崖跳下是什么感觉，从火星上3X英尺高的悬崖跳下就是什么感觉。）

太阳系最惹人注目的旅游景点也在火星上——太阳系最高的山，奥林帕斯山。

(http://beforeitsnews.com/conspiracy-theories/2015/03/olympus-mons-on-mars-the-tallest-planetary-mountain-in-the-solar-system-2468752.html)

这山大得可以覆盖整个亚利桑那州，珠峰在它面前就是一个小土丘。


(http://www.pianeta-marte.it/marte_in_cifre/english_guinnes_of_mars.htm)

更不用说火星上的峡谷，美国大峡谷跟它比起来就像是被纸片割伤了一下。


(http://www.pianeta-marte.it/marte_in_cifre/english_guinnes_of_mars.htm)

我们后面还会介绍更多火星的情况，但是理论上，只要技术足够先进，人类足够努力，就可以将火星地球化，未来某一天变成草木茂盛，海洋浩瀚的宜居星球，甚至不用穿太空服外出。
行星相对距离深度蓝框

在我们离太阳越来越远之前，先来弄明白这几个距离。你可以把太阳系大致分为三等分，每段约10亿英里，或者10天文单位长（1个天文单位即是太阳到地球的距离）：

第一段：太阳到土星
第二段：土星到天王星
第三段：天王星到海王星

所以如果太阳系是一码长，土星，天王星和海王星就都位于每隔三英尺处。木星离太阳六英寸（约5个天文单位）远，将第一段一分为二，其它四个行星都挤在第一英尺的前两英寸之内：


木星，土星，天王星和海王星



但愿你是喜欢大地的，因为其他这几个行星都没有地表。来看一下这四个遥远的行星何以至此：

46亿年前，太空中有大量的气体云层，不知为何开始凝结。宇宙中的物质很清楚这是怎么一回事——就像黑色星期五突然到来，大家都疯了似的拼命争抢集结更多的物质。每个恒星或者行星都明白，胜利的关键是先发制人。如果竞争伊始你已经拥有最大的质量，那你就可以不紧不慢地继续收集越变越大，不断增强你的优势。一旦某个星球在早期遥遥领先，其他星球就很难后来居上了。

最终的胜利者会成为恒星——其他星球就沦落为狗仔行星，围绕着恒星转上100亿年，直到恒星筋疲力竭，寿终正寝，再上演新一轮的游戏。

在我们的太阳系，赢得比赛的是太阳，在争抢中聚集了气体云层总质量的99.8%。到那时，争抢剩余的质量已经变成一场血战。那些抢到足够多质量的至少可以保留尊严，做个行星。那些努力了但是失败了的最后只能忍受屈辱，做100亿年行星的狗仔——成为卑微的卫星。

而不能成为恒星、行星或者卫星的倒霉物质就注定成为小行星——太阳系无家可归的流浪汉——或者被更大的星球吸收，完全失去自己的身份。宇宙中也是世道艰险。

在这场恶战中，有时也难免尴尬。某些经验不足的物质，不懂得太阳系形成的金科玉律——要知道自己何时被打败，愿赌服输。水星，金星，地球和火星明显一早发觉异常，明白太阳已经遥遥领先，识时务者为俊杰，随即变换策略，立志成为一个行星。

另一方面，那四个气体巨人，怀着沉痛而又绝望的心情不屈不挠地努力收集气体试图翻盘，最后也于事无补。这样一来，处境反而更糟——成了一个怪异的“似是而非的恒星”。土星的构成跟太阳一样，是氢气和氦气，但和太阳不同的是，土星的质量不足以引发聚合，只足以不断地提醒人们它在星球争霸赛中的失利。当然，气体巨人们并不肯承认。在大局已定，它们无法成为恒星时，它们四个齐刷刷地变换强调，声称自己的目标一直都是成为行星。如今，它们郁郁不得志地成了介于恒星和正常行星之间的无人之地，傲娇地做个没有地表的行星度过100亿年。谁都不想成为没有地表的行星。

我们并不完全清楚像土星这样的气体巨人内部究竟是什么情况。如果你企图去搞明白，由于土星强引力（地球引力的2.5倍）越来越快地向内吸引你，你在外太空就会被压缩。当你降落时，世界会变得黑暗，灼热，压强也越来越大。最后，你所在之地就是漆黑一片，气温会超过太阳表面的温度，沉甸甸的大气层在你之上，周遭的气体压强之大会让你感觉像液体（这被称为“超临界”状态）。氢气太浓，以至于电子开始在原子之间流动，营造出电流的液态海洋——导电金属氢。至于木星中心是否有一个固态核供你降落，就未可知了。

我们知道的是人类一定不会移居木星。或者土星。或者天王星。或者海王星。
木星和土星周围那些巨大的，坚如磐石的，并且有冰层覆盖的卫星，人类倒是有可能移居过去。但那里不会暖和。我们或许可以移居到地球自己的卫星月亮上，但月亮其实就是稍微温和的水星——白天气温可以让水沸腾蒸发，晚上的气温可以让氧气液化，并且无法抵御太阳辐射。而且28天的自转周期意味着植物要忍受连续两个星期的黑暗——这可不容易。

我问Musk，除了火星人类还有可能移居哪里，他说如果我们的科技足够发达，还是有几个地方可以去的——几颗卫星，几个最大的小行星，甚至水星和金星如果你真的疯狂的话，最后他说：“我是说，迄今为止，火星是最好的选择。”

在我们结束蓝框回到非蓝色的正文前，请认识到现在居住在地球上是多么幸福！！！想象一下我们所拥有的这些特权，室温天气，一倍的大气压强，g重力，微风拂面，大雨倾盆，浩瀚海洋，磁场和大气层对太阳的双层防御，食物遍地，还有你可以呼吸的空气。得要无穷数的因素全部都刚刚好，你才能够不用穿宇航服就可以出门散个步。接下来的七分钟让我们来感恩奢侈的地球生活，七分钟后我们又会不约而同地将这感恩忘得一干二净了。

我们重新定位一下。到现在为止，我们论证了：

备份人类硬盘是现如今不仅重要而且必要的一件事——把所有的鸡蛋都放在一个行星篮子里孤注一掷，我们就会很容易灭绝。
火星是目前备份人类硬盘最好的地方。
但随着科技进步，我们确实可以通过占领太阳系中十个甚至更多卫星、小行星和行星创建更多备份。

另一个有意思的方案：科学家们探索了一系列创意来建造看起来好玩的人造太空居住地。但其实我们现在的想法会受制于现有的想象力，对于我们来说史前人类居住在洞穴里面特别原始，我可以预见到对于未来人来说居住在行星上面也是一样的。在过去几千年，人类发明了“里面”这个概念，以致现在的人们都会把家想做是一个室内的地方——或许在将来，巨大的人造太空居住地相对整个世界来说就是“里面”，但这是一个湖光山色绿树成荫，居住着数百万人的地方，睡觉时担心天气、地震和小行星撞击，就如同洞穴人担心狼群袭击一样。可能是这样的。

不管怎样——一旦有数百万人在几个不同的星体或者居住地，那Excel文件就万无一失了，人类也得以长存。

哦对了还有

当然，所有这些硬盘备份都还同属于太阳系，如果你所有的备份都在同一栋房子里，就还是有问题的，比如房子失火。我们不但不幸遇到个注定崩溃的硬盘，也不幸住在一栋迟早会失火的房子里。太阳的寿命已经差不多过去一半了。接下来是第二幕的剧本：



恐怖统治地球以后，太阳会向外扩张，将我们潜在的家园一个接一个地毁灭。幸运的是，我们还有上图中标示为绿色的那段时期，在这段时间我们就有机会做些什么。马斯克指出，从地球之始到海洋蒸发，热浪来袭，无法生存，复杂生命灭亡，现在已经度过了这整个历程的90%——“所以如果当初智能生命的形成多用了10%的时间，那它就根本不会形成了。”说到人类进化，我们现在已经到了第九局，正是千钧一发之际——在被永久性地打出局之前，我们必须想办法扩张到地球以外，甚至太阳系以外。

有一个好消息是，这里的时间尺度都特别长。在很长的一段时间里，太阳并不会有任何不轨，我想，如果我们能够一直生存到绿色时期末期，到那时我们的科技水平一定能够使我们A）在需要的时候轻松转移到太阳系中较安全的地方，B）扩张到银河系其他适宜生物生存的恒星系，成为多恒星系物种，并且/或者C）创造出无需恒星即可产生能量的安全的太空居住地——通过原子核技术，或者通过其他我们现在还想象不到的先进技术，后者的可能性更大一些。

所以我们的待做事项包括：

1）在地球上灭绝之前，摆脱对地球的依附（通过变成多行星物种）。这就给了我们时间：

2）在太阳毁灭太阳系之前，摆脱对太阳系的依附。

说到第一项，没错，下一次大规模灭绝事件随时可能发生，但是如果我们利用接下来的几千年找到出路，扩张到地球以外，我们就可能在无可挽回的灾难到来之前得以保留自己。

所以情况看上去似乎还是可控的——但回到Zurple和Quignee。如果灭绝事件离我们还有几千甚至几百万年之远——他们两个为什么现在这个时候就在观察143-Snoogie上发生的事情还观察得这么兴致勃勃呢？

人类的可怕之处

为了强调成为多行星文明意义多么重大，Musk经常谈到只有不断拉远镜头回溯历史时所有事件才显示出其真正的重要性。镜头拉得越远，事件就要越具扭转性才能在这个维度上显现出同等的重要性。你可以在现实世界试一下这个变换镜头的游戏。在你坐的地方，街道，房子和车子都是重要的物体。但在飞机上，这些东西都消失了，只有像城市，湖泊和山脉等大型的物体才会显现出来。而在国际空间站，只有大洲和大洋是有意义的。再远一些，就只看得到行星和恒星。再远的话，只剩整个银河系了。

当你变换镜头回溯生命史（这个我们也玩过一次，在这篇文章里）时，也是同样的概念。每日新闻里的一个事件，可能是新鲜出炉的丑闻，金融市场的波动，抢劫，游行，运动盛会，或者是两个政客的会晤。这些事件都相当小，因为“重要性筛选器”的筛选条件就很小。

如果我们把镜头拉远到以年为单位，就像从地面到了飞机上——大多数每日新闻报道的事件都因太远而淡出视线，虚化为背景了。在这个距离，只有那些一年中影响最大的事件才凸显可见，而之前较难把握的大型的重要故事情节则呈现出更加清晰的轮廓——一次恶劣的恐怖袭击，一次大选，一个风靡全球的新产品或新服务。

从整个世纪的角度来看历史，就像从国际空间站回望地球。世纪性的大事，就像从飞机上无法看到的大洲和大洋的全貌——如全球蔓延的文化或政治变革，战争或其他悲惨事件以及它们所带来的改变，开创先河的科学突破，改变世界的科技进步。

如果我们再将时间视角拉远到几千年，更大型的故事线才显现出来——帝国的兴盛衰亡，宗教在全球范围的传播，科学技术的不断迭代，以及影响世界长达几个世纪的现象比如帝国主义时代，工业革命和民族国家的成立。

镜头拉远到1百万年，我们就能看到人类物种的整个发展历程。我们可以看到大迁徙，语言的发明，农耕的发明，文字和最终工业世界的发明。

然而，即使在史诗级的视角，我们还是会因为事件太过放大而不能从整体层面看清生命的历史。生命的历史比人类历史进化得缓慢得多。

甚至远至1千万年的维度，我们也只能看到生命历史的蛛丝马迹。而人类自己的进化史，我们就可以看到大猩猩日益多样化，类人-黑猩猩的部落分化，以及最终发展成为人类的人属的进化。而你从1千万年的维度来看其他生命的历史——看不到什么大事件，大多只是已有生物的演变。

如果用5千万年的视角，我们就可以看到动物界的大事件。生命越来越复杂，由鱼，到昆虫，到爬行动物，再到哺乳动物的出现，中间伴随恐龙的出现和消亡。在这个维度，那五次灭绝事件就清晰可见了。

我们再一路拉远镜头——直到38亿年——直到一端看到生命的起源，另一端是当今世界，这个维度还有什么算是重要的呢？

我们看到简单的单细胞生命，接着是复杂的单细胞生命，然后是多细胞生命。我们看到生命形式不断多样化，从海洋到了陆地，最终哺乳动物出现，进化出高等智力。

将哺乳动物和高等智力归类为生命史上最重要的事件似乎有些妄自尊大，其实并没有，因为只有通过清醒的意识，生命才能完成下一次的重大跳跃——成为多行星生物。

如果人类在火星上自给自足，那对地球上所有生物而言都将是一个重大转变，即使透过最大的伸缩镜头来看也意义非凡——它的重要性就是这个级别的。

这样一来，你就会意识到，尼尔·阿姆斯特朗将登月称为“人类的一大步”并不名符其实。登月的重要性和将人第一次送入太空或者人类第一次征服珠峰是一样的——都是伟大的成就。但如果一个海洋生物第一次触碰干燥的陆地，在那躺了一分钟随即又被冲回大海，那就不是生命的一大跳跃，登月也不是。只有当一定数量的变异了的鱼类开始在陆地自给自足地生存下来，生命才完成了一大步。同理，只有永久性地征服火星对人类来说才算是一大跳跃。但我们是不是应该停下来反思一下，在38亿年——即38, 000, 000个世纪——的历史之后，我在这声称这个世纪我们将见证有史以来六七次伟大飞跃之后的又一大进步，这是不是有些奇怪？这怎么可能呢？

等一下，这让我想起了什么。我们探究人工智能时，这些事情似乎都是理所当然的A）下个世纪会爆发超级智能，并且B）地球上的所有生命都将受到永久性的戏剧性的影响（先不论结果好坏）。这是不是也算得上潜在的一大步呢？

而且——随着我们对人类基因的认识更加深入，基因工程科学进展神速，我们是不是大可相信一百年后科学界已经找到办法不但使人类比正常的生物寿命活得更久，甚至能够让人们逆龄生长？如果我们真的如愿以偿克服了衰老，那不也是生命史上浓墨重彩的一笔吗？

这都是些什么跟什么？？

亦或是我天真得不可救药，亦或这真的是一个最好的时代。
下面是我的一些想法：

我们之前讨论过，进步的速度是呈指数型增长的，因为进步越多，接下来的进步就会越快，未来知识的大爆炸将会开启一连串级联进步。我们可以看到一系列日益突增的进步就是这样发生的：

在10万年的历史中，史前人类物种对自然界的影响远远超过了正常值——没有其他物种曾经有过如此巨大，如此广泛，如此迅速的变化。
 
拉远时间镜头，自从农业革命以来，人类在过去1万年的进步又远远超过人类史上在此之前的任何一段万年时期。

再次拉远时间镜头，工业革命以来，1815年到2015年，近两个世纪的工业和科技的突飞猛进，也是在此之前的任何一段两百年时期所不可及。

如果你把这些图放到一起，就得到了这个值得深思的趋势图：

所以或许并不是我太天真——或许我们有充足的理由相信我们确实处在前所未有的进步指数增长曲线的攀升期。而因为力量伴随进步而来，如今人类物种也拥有着史无前例的巨大影响力。

终有一天，人类的力量将会强大到一个世纪内就可以实现曾经微生物和动物生命用上亿年才完成的巨大进步。

如果一个物种变得如此强大，可以在一百年内实现广大而艰巨的跳跃性进步，那他们基本可以随心所欲地玩弄世界于股掌之间了。我们给它起个名字，叫到达神界。如果进步确实在加速，那不容置疑，终有一天某个先进的物种会到达神界，而且似乎已经有很多证据说明人类如果不是已经达到了神界就是在神界的门口了——太空旅行，人工智能，生物科技，粒子物理，纳米技术和武器技术这些领域的发展都将对未来产生一系列不可想象的深远影响。

其中会有很多积极的发展可能实现人类永生，也会有更多可能毁灭物种的 恐怖的末日景象，导致大规模灭绝，甚至结束所有的生命——什么都有可能，从计划性病害，粒子对撞机灾难，到失控的纳米机器人连锁反应，到出乎意外地对人类充满敌意的人工超级智能，到失控的气候变化，到更多我们受制于现在的技术水平还想象不到的事情。

大多数今天讨论的好的或者坏的巨大影响事件最终并不会发生，但有些很有可能发生——尤其随着科技继续进步——事实是，我们在有生之年真的能够见证几次堪比生命由海洋到陆地这样影响巨大的事件。或许我们不仅正处在人类成为多行星物种这一伟大进步的前夕，我们可能也正处在另外几大人类进步的前夕。

还有其他现象也显示出这是一个非比寻常的时代：

人类历史中99.8%的时间，世界人口都不足10亿。但在最近0.2%的历史时期，世界人口突破了10，20，30，40，50，60和70亿几个大关。

直到25年前，地球上还从未有过这样一个全球化的大脑，拥有无所不知的信息渠道和连接。现在我们有互联网。

人类历史的前99800年中几乎没怎么使用能源，而在过去200年间，我们突然奔入化石燃料时代，大量消耗地下储存的碳能源，即使没想明白这样做意味着什么。

在过去1000个世纪中的999个世纪，人类都是徒步行走或者骑马出行。而到了这个世纪，我们开车，乘飞机，甚至登上了月球。

如果外星生物真的在寻找宇宙中其他生命的话，这个世纪会比之前任何世纪都更容易找到我们，因为人类向太空发射了数以百万计的信号。

自从动物生命存在以来，平均每隔100百万年发生一次大规模灭绝事件，按这个时间算来，我们可能刚好在酝酿第六次。

如果我们退一步看看这些情况，就应该看明白现在发生的所有事都不正常。当前人类拥有的力量地球上其他任何生命都不曾拥有，而且极有可能的是，十亿年之后，一个历史专业的外星人撰写学期论文研究地球上的生命史，我们现在所处的时期——无论最终结果如何——都会成为这篇论文的重要部分。

这也正是为什么Zurple和Quignee现在这么深陷其中。他们看着手机，收到IntelligenceWatch App的一条新的告警信息：

143-Snoogie星球上的生命已达到神界。

Zurple和Quignee不是在等小行星撞击，或者太阳陨灭，或者近距离的超新星爆发——他们是想看接下来的一百年会发生什么。这才是他们的赌局。当一个星球上的生命达到高等智力，通常就意味着他们离自己不成功便成仁的时刻也就几十万年了。他们的进步会越来越快直到最终到达神界，同时他们也会积聚力量，要么得到永生，要么意外灭亡——全在于哪一个先发生。

这就是为什么IntelligenceWatch的第一条告警消息说这里的生命达到了“致命的智力水平”——因为拉远时间镜头来看，获得最初的智力是胚胎阶段，只有到达神界才能决定这个物种会遭受流产还是会成为永存的新生智慧物种。那些到达神界的物种，不可避免地进入接踵而至的一片混乱，然后莫名其妙地从另一边活着出来，就算“通关”了，正式晋升为宇宙中成熟，永生，智慧的物种。

Zurple和Quignee因为他们的赌约已经认识143-Snoogie星球一段时间了，但是任何到达神界的银河系生命都意义非凡，并且极具观赏性，所以最近，143-Snoogie就成了Uvuvuwu整个星球都在留意的新闻，每个人都在追着这个故事，想看看143-Snoogie上面的生命到底能不能通关。

哪怕有很小的概率我所讲的是正确的，我们真的已经达到了进步的临界点，拥有无所不能的新力量，无人知晓并且无法预计任何后果——而且我们使用起这种力量来真的是太业余了。。。

那么现在不正是备份硬盘的绝佳时机吗？

你只需要站在Quignee的立场——想象你在反对某个遥远的物种。你手上有大笔钱，你真的希望他们灭绝。如果那个物种成为了多行星物种，你得多么恼火？人类征服火星是Quignee最不希望发生的事情。诚然，即使物种在多个行星生存，还是有一些灾难可能会消灭他们，但是如果所有的鸡蛋都放在同一个篮子里，那物种灭绝就太容易了——而备份硬盘将大大减小他的胜算。

同时，桌子对面，Zurple紧紧盯着屏幕，口中念念有词，“加油加油加～～～油。”他的屏幕锁定在加利福尼亚州霍索恩的一栋工业化风格的建筑上——那里是SpaceX公司总部。

Musk不是唯一一个想着火星的人。

Stephen Hawking曾说：

我认为除非人类扩张到太空，否则接下来的几千年人类将无法存活下去……我们的生存面临着很多威胁，核战争，灾难性的全球变暖，计划性基因病害；未来，随着新科技发展，误入歧途的方式也日新月异，威胁还会更多……如果我们要有一个长远的未来，那就需要拓宽视野到地球以外，扩张到太空，到其他恒星，这样地球上的灾难才不会成为人类的终结……一旦我们扩张到了太空，建立了独立的殖民地，我们的未来就是安全的。(摘自：http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1359562/Colonies-in-space-may-be-only-hope-says-Hawking.html)

普林斯顿J. Richard Gott教授：

1970年所有人都预测到现在为止火星上会有人类了，但是我们没有把握住时机。我们应该尽快来做这件事，因为征服其他世界是减少我们的损失，同时提高人类物种存活概率的最好机会。等到我们身处绝境再后悔没有征服火星，就为时晚矣。(摘自：http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/17/science/17tier.html?ex=1342324800&en=ccf375ae9f268470&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&_r=1)

NASA官员Michael Griffin：

长期来讲单行星物种将无法存活下去……如果人类想要生存几十或者几百万年，最终我们一定要移民到其他行星……有一天，在地球之外生活的人类会超过在地球之上生活的人类。(摘自：http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/23/AR2005092301691.html)

科幻小说家Larry Niven文可能说得最好：

恐龙因为没有太空项目已经灭绝了。如果我们也因为没有太空项目而最终灭绝，那我们就是活该！(摘自：http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/16687-the-dinosaurs-became-extinct-because-they-didn-t-have-a-space)

最让Musk担心的是费米悖论。我们从未见到过任何外星生物存在的证据，这太古怪了，不得不让他怀疑，宇宙中曾有“很多已经灭亡的单行星文化”。他警告说，“如果生命确实千载难遇，我们最好尽快实现多行星存活，如果文明岌岌可危，那我们一定要竭尽全力去大幅提高我们微弱的存活率。”

那是2001年一个朋友问Musk在Paypal之后他有什么打算时，Musk的想法。Musk回忆那次谈话：“我对他说，其实，我一直对太空很感兴趣，可又觉得作为一个个人并没有什么可以做的。但是，我接着说，似乎毫无疑问我们要将人类送上火星。说着说着我开始奇怪为什么我们还没开始送。后来我去查NASA网站看究竟什么时候可以去火星。”(摘自：http://www.wired.com/2012/10/ff-elon-musk-qa/all/）

然而当他浏览网站时，震惊地发现……什么都没有。自从70年代初NASA的预算第一次被缩减之后，因为争取不到资金，去火星的计划就被一推再推。现在，根本就没有计划了。

所以Musk决定出手相助——他要在火星上种一棵植物。这个计划——被称作火星绿洲——给火星送去一个小型的自动温室，这是对火星的一项慈善使命。自动温室会用一只手臂铲起火星的土壤，种下一粒种子，等到植物长成，温室就发回Musk称之为“用钱砸出来”的——一张照片，红色的外星背景中一株茁壮的绿色植物，并且是火星上（已知）的第一个生命。

这个想法其实是，通过这个哗众取宠的表演，再次唤醒人们对太空旅行的激情，激励一批青少年投身航空航天事业——最终，Musk希望，这件事能够重燃公众兴趣，增加NASA的预算。Musk当时相信——现在也还相信——0.25%的美国GDP，或者大约1%的预算，应当用于太空探索。他说得很清楚，他并不是建议回到60年代4%的预算的好日子——只是比现在多点，现在是低于0.5%。“只要1%，”他说，“我们就可以给人类生命买个保险。”

随着PayPal卖给eBay的时间越来越近，Musk的日子过得很轻松，他纠集了一帮太空人事和他一起搞火星绿洲计划。他们需要一个火箭来做这件事，Musk可以用一部分他在PayPal的盈利去买一艘。当时美国最便宜的火箭也要6500万美元，但是在俄罗斯一个二手的火箭价格只是这个数字的零头——启程去俄罗斯。Musk去跟人家商谈购买三个翻新的洲际弹道导弹。三个导弹马斯克最多愿意付2000万美元，但是俄罗斯想要更多。他空着手走了。

就在那时候他下决心——要自己做。

不是植物的那个项目——而是一个大项目。

他花了几个月，如饥似渴地阅读关于火箭技术以及如何自己制造火箭，相信是可以做到的。

他可以将一百万人送往火星上。 

There are some tough “going from A to B” situations in life. Going from A) I can’t believe my alarm just went off to B) Now I’m sitting at work. From A) My lease ends next month to B) Now I’m totally moved into a new apartment and all the things are even hung on the walls. From A) Oh shit wait I actually hate my wife to B) Oh good now I have a new wife and everything’s good. These are all tough.

But A) I think I’d like to put 1,000,000 people on Mars to B) Now there are 1,000,000 people on Mars—that one seems extra difficult.

Elon Musk is more ambitious than you.

Since the beginning of this project, I’ve spoken with Musk six times, not that I’m counting, and much of that time was spent talking about how this Mars thing is actually going to happen. From the sound of it, he really just needs two things and then he’ll be all set:

1) A will

2) A way

The conventional wisdom might be that this is a case of, “If there’s a will, there’s a way.” We went to the moon over four decades ago, 15 years before anyone owned a computer, so it seems like Mars could have been perfectly doable by now—the limiting factor must be a lack of will.

But Musk believes it’s the other way around. What we have is a way to go to Mars for an astronomical amount of money. And that’s no way to colonize Mars. To Musk, what’s missing is a way to go to Mars affordably. He calls the United States “a nation of explorers” and “the spirit of human exploration distilled,” and he believes that if going to Mars were much cheaper, plenty of will would arise. But because this isn’t something that’s been remotely possible, no one is talking about it, and whatever will there is in people to go to Mars is totally dormant.

If someone told me that a penthouse apartment in Manhattan with a huge balcony had dropped in price by 95%, I’d have plenty of will to sign a lease and move in. But because the price is what it is, I’m not burning with a desire to move in—I’m not even thinking about it. The reason I’m not writing this post while sitting in a hot tub overlooking the New York skyline isn’t a lack of will, it’s a lack of way.

Musk sees the Mars situation the same way. Rather than “If there’s a will, there’s a way,” he seems to believe it’s more a case of, “If you build it, they will come.”

Specifically, the model Musk has in mind is that “flights” to Mars will be funded by the passengers riding on them, the same way public transportation works on Earth—and the key will be to bring ticket prices down far enough that a million people will buy one. Or as he explained to me, in Musk-speak:

There has to be an intersection of sets of people who wish to go to Mars and people who can afford to go to Mars, and if that intersection of sets equals a number of people necessary to make Mars self-sustaining, that’s the critical solution.

So kinda like:

Venn3

The problem is, right now it’s more like:

Venn2

Since Musk thinks the will (the yellow circle) will grow accordingly when there exists a feasible way, Musk identifies the tiny blue circle as the critical limiting factor: the dramatically-too-high cost of space travel. And fixing that, he believes, will be the key link between A and B.

So, in 2002, Musk explored further: “I put together a team, and over a series of Saturdays I had them do a feasibility study about building rockets more efficiently. It became clear that there wasn’t anything to prevent us from doing it. Rocket technology had not materially improved since the ’60s—arguably it had gone backward!”1 He was pumped.

But back to reality for a second. If you decided that revolutionizing the cost of space travel was the key to something very important, you wouldn’t be like, “Great! I’m gonna do it!”, you’d be like, “I don’t know how to do that.” To get our heads around how one might achieve such a thing, let’s imagine that we’re trying to do it and work backwards:

Q: How do I revolutionize the cost of space travel?

A: With decades of innovation, hundreds of trial and error launches, and thousands of super-smart people working on it. Straightforward, but icky. It’s icky because:

Q: Where the hell is the money gonna come from to pay for that? If the government were interested in funding it, they’d have done it themselves already. And no charitable donor is going to put tens of billions of dollars toward funding a massive, 30+ year project that has no guarantee to work.

A: You pay for it by making your research and development operation double as a profitable space delivery service. To test your innovative new technology, you’ll need to do a lot of launches. Governments and companies will pay you a ton of money to take satellites, cargo, and people up to space during those launches. Two birds with one stone.

Q: But how do I know how to launch something into space?

A: You don’t. You have to spend a few years learning how to do it from scratch, and building all of the vehicles yourself, and proving that you can launch successfully before anyone will hire you as a delivery service.

Q: But if there aren’t any customers during the initial learning and development stage, who pays for that stage?

A: You, the founder.

Q: How do I get the money for that?

A: You co-found PayPal and then sell it.

So that’s the logic that Musk thought through back in 2001, and it dictated SpaceX’s business plan:

SpaceX Business Plan

SpaceX has been at it for 13 years now. Let’s go through what’s happened so far and what still lies ahead.

Phase 1: Figure out how to put things into space

Main Character: Falcon 1        

Goal: Launch something into orbit before Musk runs out of money

Phase 1 really started before SpaceX even existed, back in mid-2001 while Musk was still at PayPal. Strongly considering entering the space arena as his next move, Musk did what everyone does when they want to become a world-class rocket scientist in about a year with no schooling—he read some stuff.

He read books like this and this and this and this and basically memorized all of them. Rocket expert Jim Cantrell, who met Musk around that time and was on the failed trip to Russia with him, says “He would quote passages verbatim from these books. He became very conversant in the material.”2

To supplement his reading, Musk asked a lot of questions of a lot of people. Cantrell, who calls Musk “by far the single smartest person that I have ever worked with,” says that Musk “hired as many of my colleagues in the rocket and spacecraft business that were willing to consult with him” and that “it was as if he would suck the experience out of them.”3

As Musk started to talk more and more seriously about making space his next big pursuit, Musk’s friends were worried about him. Wouldn’t you be? Imagine if your friend made a huge amount of money selling an internet business and then told you he was going to spend almost all of it trying to become the first entrepreneur to succeed at building a space launch company—because it was important that human life become multi-planetary. You wouldn’t feel good about this. One of Musk’s friends did his best to talk him out of the insane project by putting together a montage of rockets blowing up and forcing Musk to watch it.

But Musk is an odd duck, and he continued along unfazed.1 After building himself a tree trunk foundation of knowledge, it was time to get other people on board. When I asked Musk about his knowledge of business, he scolded me, explaining, “I don’t know what a business is. All a company is is a bunch of people together to create a product or service. There’s no such thing as a business, just pursuit of a goal—a group of people pursuing a goal.”

So he started assembling a group of the smartest people he could find, and SpaceX was born.

Then the core team of all-stars, which included renowned rocket engineer Tom Mueller, began to hire. Some early SpaceX hiring policies:

No assholes. Musk says that if you hate your colleagues or boss, you won’t want to come to work and stay for long hours.

Hire (and promote) based on raw talent, not experience. Musk has said he doesn’t care that much about a grad degree, college degree, or even a high school degree—just raw talent, personality, and passion for the SpaceX mission. I sat down with SpaceX’s VP of Vehicle Engineering, Mark Juncosa, who I was surprised to learn is a casual California bro. He seemed like some silly dude I’d be friends with, not a leading rocket scientist. He told me he was a terrible student and on his way to being a burnout of a human when he found an affinity for working on race cars2 at the car club where he went to college. Turns out he was a total genius at it, and after school someone introduced him to Musk, who hired him. Juncosa quickly rose up at the company and now, in his early 30s, he’s in charge of one of the major departments of the company, with hundreds of far more experienced people working for him.

There seem to be lots of stories like this that reflect on SpaceX being unusually meritocratic—I met with Zach Dunn, the Senior Director of Launch Engineering, who seemed to be about 12 years old. Dunn told me he started as an intern just a few years ago. Early on, when he assumed Musk had no idea who he was, Musk surprised him by telling Dunn he thought he was a very strong engineer, which made Dunn realize that Musk is acutely aware of everyone at the company. A few years later, Dunn was put in charge of launch engineering and more than 100 employees.

Musk interviews everyone, including janitors, and does so like a weirdo. This rule held with almost no exception through the first eight years of the company’s life, up to the company having 1,000 employees. According to Musk’s biography, “Each employee receives a warning before going to meet with Musk. The interview, he or she is told, could last anywhere from thirty seconds to fifteen minutes. Elon will likely keep on writing e-mails and working during the initial part of the interview and not speak much. Don’t panic. That’s normal. Eventually, he will turn around in his chair to face you. Even then, though, he might not make actual eye contact with you or fully acknowledge your presence. Don’t panic. That’s normal. In due course, he will speak to you.”3

The company itself, like Tesla, is heavily vertically integrated. This means that rather than outsource most of the parts of the rocket-making process to third party suppliers, SpaceX does nearly all of the major pieces itself, maintaining ownership and control over most of the supply chain. This is highly unusual in the aerospace industry—as Ashlee Vance explains, “The factory is a temple devoted to what SpaceX sees as its major weapon in the rocket-building game, in-house manufacturing. SpaceX manufactures between 80 percent and 90 percent of its rockets, engines, electronics, and … designs its own motherboards and circuits, sensors to detect vibrations, flight computers, and solar panels.” Old-fashioned industrialists, like Andrew Carnegie and Henry Ford, were all about vertical integration, as is Apple today in many ways. Most of today’s companies avoid taking on the massive scope vertical integration requires, but for a quality control freak, like Musk or Jobs, it’s the only way they’d have it.

On top of so many parts of the process being merged together under the SpaceX roof, they’re physically enmeshed together in the building, just like at Tesla—engineers on their computers are stationed either out on the floor amidst the design and manufacturing or in all-glass offices with the assembly process visible all around them.

As the team grew and departments formed, Musk remained intimately involved in almost every process in a truly unusual way. Some bosses are called micromanagers—at Musk’s companies, his level of involvement earned him the term “nanomanager.”

Elon Musk Knows a Lot of Shit Blue Box

Almost every person I talked to at both Tesla and SpaceX emphasized how much of an expert Musk is at their particular field, whether that field be car batteries, car design, electric motors, rocket structures, rocket engines, rocket electronics (“avionics”), or aerospace engineering. He can do this because of a combination of his immensely thick tree trunk of fundamental understanding of physics and engineering and his genius-level ability to retain information as he learns it.

It’s that insane breadth of expertise that allows Musk to maintain such an abnormally high level of control over everything that happens at his companies. About SpaceX’s rockets, Musk said, “I know my rocket inside out and backward. I can tell you the heat treating temper of the skin material, where it changes, why we chose that material, the welding technique…down to the gnat’s ass.”4

I asked SpaceX’s VP of Software Engineering, Jinnah Hosein, about Musk’s nanomanagement. He said:

The biggest surprise for anyone first joining the company—SpaceX throws around term “nanomanager,” and you’re like, “Okay he likes to go down in the weeds, that’s cool”—but you have no idea. For the CEO of the company, he has an incredibly deep stack—he has all that info available to him, and he can drill down on any one thing, and often does. He’s making very low-level decisions and very low-level course directions for the company, with high fidelity, and I can’t imagine it working with anyone else at any other company. The thought of one person being a key decision point for so many things is remarkable to me—he can hold it all it in his head and recall it on demand in real time, as necessary, in order to be able to make good decisions.

Okay so now it’s mid-2002, and this crazy idea is starting to become a real thing. There’s a clear mission, a team, and a force-of-nature CEO. Next step—a rocket.

Before we get into SpaceX’s first rocket, let’s get clear on terms:

The point of almost any space launch is to take something to space. The thing you’re taking is called the payload. A payload can be a satellite, cargo, people, a monkey4—anything.

In order to survive the rough trip to space, the payload is sometimes inside a protective shell called a fairing. Other times, the payload needs to be steered, navigated, and docked when it’s out in space and maybe even be brought back to Earth. In that case, the payload is carried inside of a spacecraft or, if you’re nine, a spaceship.

Then you have the rocket. The rocket is the main big thing that launches, and it has one job: to carry the payload and its container up through the atmosphere and put it into space. Most of the rocket is a big fuel tank, and at the bottom of a rocket is one or more insanely powerful, bell-shaped engines. These provide the immense force—or thrust—that it takes to lift many tons of weight up through Earth’s atmosphere. Sometimes a rocket is made up of multiple smaller rockets called stages. Oh, and everything I just described becomes a missile if the payload is a weapon.

Finally, a rocketship is not a thing. A rocketship is a term to make a four-year-old excited about life—that’s it.

The Apollo missions went to the moon using an enormous rocket called the Saturn V. Saturn V weighed 3,000 tons—about as much as seven Boeing 747s—and was the height of a 35-story building.5

SATURN1

Saturn V was like one of those satisfying Russian doll sets where it keeps getting smaller and smaller. Here are all the pieces:6

SATURN

The Space Shuttle, with a much simpler job of only ever going into Low Earth Orbit, took a totally different approach.

Instead of one big first stage rocket, the Space Shuttle used two rockets (called solid rocket boosters)5 to do the meat of the heavy part of the ascent, and the payload—people and equipment—rode in the shuttle spacecraft, which they really made look like a stereotypical spaceship. The spacecraft provided the rest of the boost after the rockets dropped away, using fuel from the big, for-some-reason-orange fuel tank. Normally, returning spacecraft6 land in the ocean using parachutes, but the Space Shuttle took a more civilized approach, landing on a runway like an airplane:7

Space_shuttle_mission_profile

When SpaceX made their first rocket, they weren’t trying to do the biggest, baddest thing that had ever been done. Instead, they built what was kind of their training-wheels rocket, a small, straightforward rocket Musk named Falcon 1 (after the Millennium Falcon in Star Wars). It was a 70-foot-tall (21 m), two-stage rocket with one super-powerful engine at the bottom—SpaceX’s own invention, the Merlin engine.8

SPAC_Falcon_1_Vertical_lg

Despite its modest size and capability, Falcon 1 was full of innovative new technology. The primary goal was to make it cheaper than ever before to take small payloads into space—not just because Musk sees cost-reduction as the way to get us to Mars, but because he sees it as the only aspect of space travel that currently can be improved in a meaningful way. He says, “Speed for a rocket is always going to be roughly the same. The convenience and comfort is going to be about the same. Reliability…there’s not going to be much improvement there. So you’re really left with one key parameter against which technology improvements must be judged, and that’s cost.”

Musk cites two reasons costs have remained so high:

1) The only companies in aerospace are huge, and huge companies are risk averse. He says, “There’s a tremendous bias against taking risks. Everyone is trying to optimize their ass-covering … Even if better technology is available, they’re still using legacy components, often ones that were developed in the 1960s … [many] use Russian rocket engines that were made in the ’60s. I don’t mean their design is from the ’60s—I mean they start with engines that were literally made in the ’60s and, like, packed away in Siberia somewhere.”

2) Not enough vertical integration. We mentioned SpaceX’s vertical integration and the full control it affords Musk over what happens at SpaceX, but Musk also believes the vertical structure is critical to keeping costs down, and he criticizes the rest of the industry for not doing so: “There’s this tendency of big aerospace companies to outsource everything … They outsource to subcontractors, and then the subcontractors outsource to sub-subcontractors, and so on. You have to go four or five layers down to find somebody actually doing something useful—actually cutting metal, shaping atoms. Every level above that tacks on profit—it’s overhead to the fifth power.”9

Without the baggage of a huge company with a long history, SpaceX was able to “design and develop [Falcon 1] from the ground up from a blank sheet of paper,” says Max Vozoff, an early SpaceX employee,10 and you can see the “blank sheet of paper” mindset in Musk’s ground-up reasoning: “[I asked], What is a rocket made of? Aerospace-grade aluminum alloys, plus some titanium, copper, and carbon fiber. And then I asked, what is the value of those materials on the commodity market? It turned out that the materials cost of a rocket was around 2 percent of the typical price—which is a crazy ratio for a large mechanical product…So, I thought, we should be able to make a much cheaper rocket given those materials costs.”11

And that’s all great—but this was not a normal company with a normal budget and timeframe for development. This was a venture few sane investors would touch, and the ability for the company to exist rode largely on Elon Musk’s personal bank account. By the time 2006 rolled around, Musk had decided to revolutionize the automotive industry as a side project, and with $70 million of his PayPal fortune tied up in Tesla, that left about $100 million for SpaceX. Musk said this would be enough for “three or four launches.” SpaceX would have that many tries to prove it was worthy of paying customers. And since the thing paying customers would want is for SpaceX to deliver a payload of theirs into orbit, that’s what SpaceX needed to do—successfully launch something into orbit to show the world that they were for real.

So the game was simple—launch a payload into orbit in three or possibly four tries, or the company was done. At the time, of the many private companies who had tried to put something into orbit (see the dearth of “operational” companies on this list), only one had ever succeeded (Orbital Sciences).

To understand why this is such a hard thing to do, we have to understand what an orbit is. 

What is an orbit?

It’s intuitive to think that the challenge of putting an object in orbit is the difficulty of getting it up to orbit, just like it’s intuitive to think that the astronauts in the ISS are floating around because there’s no gravity up in space where they are. This is a good time to stop trusting your intuition.

Let’s zip back to high school for a second. Here’s the equation we use to figure out the force of gravity:

Gravity Equation

G is the gravitational constant, a super-icky number we can ignore for this exercise.

m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects. There are two objects because gravity isn’t a one-way thing—every two objects attract each other with an equal force. In the case of you and the Earth, what you think of as your weight is the force of gravity between you and the Earth, a force acting equally on you and the planet.7 And because the two mass numbers are in the numerator, it means that when they go up, the force of gravity will go up too (proportional to their product). So if I doubled your mass, your weight would double. If I left your mass the same but doubled the Earth’s mass—again, your weight would double. If I doubled both your and the Earth’s mass—your weight would quadruple. For our purposes in this post, we don’t need to work with mass.

What we care about is the d2 part. d is the distance between the two objects—or more specifically, the distance between the centers of mass of the two objects. In the case of the Earth, the mass is symmetrically distributed, so the center of mass is the center of the planet. The Earth’s radius is 3,959 miles (6,371 km), so when you’re on the surface of the Earth, that’s the number you use for d to determine the force of gravity you’re experiencing. Because d is in the denominator of the equation, as d grows, the force of gravity decreases.

To illustrate all this, I’m going to shrink the Earth down to about one 13-millionth of its size, so that it’s exactly one meter in diameter:

Meter Earth

If we double d by moving an Earth radius away from the surface (half a meter), d2 goes up by 4x, so the force of gravity, and your weight, would be a quarter of what they are on the surface. If you moved to a full meter away—where you could fit a full Earth between you and the Earth—d has now tripled and your gravity is 1/9 of what it is on Earth.8

And where does the ISS fall in all of this?

It’s between 205 and 255 miles away, which on our meter globe is about 2-3 cm, or a little over an inch from the surface. If a ping pong ball were stuck to the globe, the ISS (and a lot of satellites) would run into it. (While we’re here, the commonly-recognized altitude where “space” starts is the Kármán line, 62 mi (100 km) up, which on our globe starts 7.8 mm above the surface—about the width of a pencil. And an airplane flies at .84 mm off the surface, about the height of a grain of sand.)

So what does that mean about gravity in Low Earth Orbit, in a place like the ISS?

Well if we take the mid-point of the average altitude of the ISS (230 mi), we find that being at that height adds only 5.8% to the normal d on Earth’s surface, which only brings surface gravity down by about 10%.

Meter Earth gravity

So ISS astronauts should barely feel the gravity difference. And yet, they’re floating.

The reason is they’re in free fall.

I once had a chance to fly in a little plane with a pilot who didn’t give a shit, so he brought the plane up to 4,000 feet and then quickly dropped to 2,000 feet. Before the drop, he handed me a pen and told me to rest it on my open palm. During the drop, the 8% of me not in bed-shitting survival mode saw the pen hover in front of me and gently float over to the side before abruptly dropping into my lap when we leveled off again at 2,000 feet. This is what’s happening inside the ISS at all times.

Here’s why: picture you’re standing on a cliff on a planet smaller and smoother than the Earth and with no atmosphere—and you throw a baseball as hard as you can.

orbit1

It would go something like this:

orbit2

Now what if a major league pitcher gave it a try. It might look like this:

orbit3

And what if you fired the ball out of a cannon? It would go even further.

orbit4

Before each of these balls hits the ground, they fly in a curved path. If the planet’s surface didn’t get in the way, those paths would continue as long ellipses. To keep things simple, let’s just match each path up with a circle whose curve lines up with it ball’s trajectory pretty well:

orbit5

Now let’s get a much more powerful cannon, and it does this:

orbit6

Seems normal, but notice that the arc’s curve is matching the shape of the planet. So what ends up happening is this:

orbit6a

The ball would circle the planet and run into the back of the cannon. And if nothing were there to block it, the ball would continue “falling” forever, never able to land. Because the ball’s path’s curve, and corresponding circle, match up exactly with the curvature of the planet, the planet keeps falling away from the ball as the ball tries to fall down to the ground. You’ve put the ball in orbit.

If you had a perfectly smooth planet of any size, and it had no atmosphere at all, you could in theory put something into orbit right above the ground. But because the Earth has a thick atmosphere (and an uneven surface with mountains), no matter how hard you fired a ball near the surface, the atmosphere would slow it down, making its path’s curvature tighter and tighter until it fell out of orbit and hit the ground. That’s why everything we put in orbit is high up, where the atmosphere is so thin it doesn’t slow the object down. And without any force of friction to interfere, Newton’s Law of Inertia kicks in and it’ll circle the planet forever.9

In order to fall into orbit around the Earth, an object has to be moving unbelievably fast. But not too fast. Why? Because then the curve is too broad, the corresponding circle is bigger than the planet, and this happens:

orbit7

That’s why people talk about something reaching “orbital velocity” to stay in orbit, and “escape velocity” to escape from the Earth’s gravity well and head out into space. Escape velocity just means the arc the path makes is broader than the curvature of the planet.

So what’s orbital velocity at about a 230 mi altitude where the ISS is? 17,150 mph (27,600 km/h). Or 4.76 mi / 7.66 km per second. That’s the goldilocks speed that will keep an object in orbit at that height.

To get a feel for how fast that is, if you threw a ball at that speed from the beach into the ocean, it would zing out and over the horizon, out of sight, in about a half a second. At that speed, the ISS circles the Earth every 90 minutes (and yet, because velocity is relative, the astronauts in the ISS don’t feel like they’re moving at all, the same way you don’t on an airplane).

Back to SpaceX. Given the blue box above, it makes sense that SpaceX’s challenge was to essentially “throw” a payload up into orbit. People think a rocket launch goes up, but really it’s throwing something really hard sideways, which is why a rocket’s trajectory looks like this:12

arc

It’s like our examples above, and the rocket is acting like the hand of a giant who’s throwing the payload:

orbit0 throw

orbit0 throw 1

Except in the real world, instead of an arm and a hand, a rocket company has to throw the payload with a seven-story high, 40-ton10 metal tower that explodes away from the Earth, and it’ll need to ping a delicate machine out at just the right altitude, at just the right speed.

To make things even harder, the “throw” starts off in the sea-level atmosphere, which is both molasses-thick and full of moving parts (i.e. weather). It’s like trying to throw a ball with precision with your hand starting under a few feet of flowing water. SpaceX’s head of vehicle engineering, Mark Juncosa, described the challenge of guiding a rocket up through the atmosphere: “The rocket is like a wet noodle and you’re trying to push it to space. It’s flopping around like hell. You can’t even figure out where it’s going by measuring the trajectory of any one point on the rocket—you have to measure a few points.”

And with such large forces in play—the weight of the rocket, the speeds, the thick atmosphere—even a tiny equipment malfunction can immediately destroy the mission. The problem is, you can’t reliably test exactly how the equipment will hold up until it actually launches.

SpaceX learned all of this the hard way.

2006: First launch—failure

2007: Second launch—failure

2008: Third launch—failure

Bad times.

The failures were caused by tiny things. Specifically, a corroded nut not holding up under the pressure, liquid in the rocket sloshing around more than expected, and the first stage engines shutting down a few seconds too late during stage separation. You can get everything 99.9% right, and the last .1% will explode the rocket in a catastrophic failure. Space is hard.

Every rocket-launching government or company—each and every one—has failures. It’s part of the gig. Normally, you take a deep breath, roll up your sleeves, figure out what went wrong, and move on to the next launch. But SpaceX had special circumstances—the company had money for “three or four launches,” and after three failures, the only launch they had left was the Or Four one. It was scheduled for less than two months after the third launch failed. And this was the last chance.

A friend of Musk, Adeo Ressi, describes it like this: “Everything hinged on that launch … If it works, epic success. If it fails — if one thing goes differently and it fails — epic failure. No in between. No partial credit. He’d had three failures already. It would have been over. We’re talking Harvard Business School case study — rich guy who goes into the rocket business and loses it all.”1311

But on September 28, 2008, SpaceX set off the fourth launch—and nailed it.12 They put a dummy payload into orbit without a hitch, becoming only the second privately-funded company ever to do so.

Falcon 1 was also the most cost-efficient rocket ever to launch—priced at $7.9 million, it cost less than a third of the best US alternative at the time.

NASA took notice. The successful fourth launch was enough evidence for them that SpaceX was worth trusting, and at the end of 2008, NASA called Musk and told him they wanted to offer SpaceX a $1.6 billion contract to make 12 deliveries for them to the ISS.

Musk’s money had done its job. SpaceX had customers now and a long future ahead.

Phase 2: Revolutionize the cost of space travel

Main Characters: Falcon 9, Dragon, Falcon Heavy

Goal: Get the price for a trip to Mars down to $500,000/seat

SpaceX Business Plan 2

Today, many people have heard of SpaceX. Few know what SpaceX does. And even fewer know what SpaceX really does.

Here’s what SpaceX does: It takes things to space for people, for money.

And as we established, here’s what SpaceX really does: It’s an innovation machine, trying to solve one big problem—the astronomical cost of space travel—because that’s the key to making humanity a space-faring civilization that can become multi-planetary and back itself up on other hard drives. It supports itself by taking things to space for people, for money.

We’ll get to the really does part later. First, let’s look at what it means to take things to space for people, for money.

Falcon 9

In 2008, with a successful orbital launch achieved and a slew of new customers eager to sign up for SpaceX’s weirdly cheap space delivery service, it was time for SpaceX to take off the training wheels and build themselves a Harley. Meet Falcon 9:1

FALCON9

Let’s just go ahead and get it out of the way right now—Falcon 9 is the world’s largest dick-shaped sculpture. It’s something every SpaceX employee has learned to endure, an unmentionable fact that hovers over their professional lives, and it’s something we’re all going to live with as well.

That issue aside, Falcon 9 is the world’s most advanced rocket and a huge upgrade over Falcon 1. Falcon 9 is huge—at 224 feet (68 m) tall, it’s over three times the height of Falcon 1 and the height of a 20-story building. On its side, it would stretch 3/4 the way across a football field. And while Falcon 1 could bring less than one ton of payload to orbit, Falcon 9 can carry 13 tons. In every way, Falcon 9 puts SpaceX in the ring with the big boys.2

rocket comparison

Learning about rockets will make you respect the shit out of rockets. A rocket has to be unbelievably rugged—it’s a 1,000-ton object filled with explosive material that soars at blazing speeds through hurricane-force winds—but also meticulously designed down to the millimeter because it’s full of very un-rugged things like computer circuit boards, delicate satellites, and living people. Normal manufacturing techniques don’t always cut it for an object so particular—in the SpaceX factory, I was shown bizarre-shaped Falcon 9 parts that had to be 3D printed (and 3D designed) because there was no other good method to make them just the right way.1

But since none of that is our problem, let’s ignore all the details and oversimplify:3

falcon labeled

The First Stage

The first stage has a very important three-minute job—blast the second stage and the attached payload up to an altitude of about 100km before peacing out and falling into the ocean.4

v

The first stage, like almost all parts of Falcon 9, is manufactured in SpaceX’s California headquarters (here’s a fast-motion video of the manufacture process).

Most of the first stage is a big fuel tank with two key parts: a huge tank of rocket-grade kerosene next to a huge tank of liquid oxygen. It doesn’t work on a rocket to draw oxygen from the air because, among other reasons, the rocket quickly gets too high up for there to be much oxygen around. So it has to bring the oxygen with it. Oxygen becomes a liquid at -297.3 F (-183 C), and once it does, it’s around 1,000 times more dense than gaseous oxygen—so you can pack a lot of it. These two ingredients are mixed together into explosive propellant.

How Rocket Engines Work

It might seem odd that the guy who’s super not into burning fossil fuels with his car company would choose to blow through hundreds of tons of it during every launch with his rocket company. The problem is that rockets have to burn fuel—Musk has even said he thinks all transportation will eventually go electric, except rockets.

The reason is Newton’s Third Law: Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.

Newton’s third law is why a deflating balloon will move in the opposite direction that it’s shooting air out, why a gun jolts backward when it shoots, and why this incompetent man’s canoe goes away from the dock when he runs toward it:5

jump

When you think about propelling a vehicle, think about this same idea.

One way to make a vehicle move is with a propeller. Propellers work by pushing air in one direction, which pushes the propeller and whatever’s attached to it in the other direction—kind of like standing a foot away from a wall and pushing the wall with your hand—which forces your body away from the wall. The problem is that in space, there’s no air for the propeller to push against, so trying to use a propeller there is like standing in a room far away from the wall and pushing your hand out toward nothing like a weirdo, which wouldn’t push you backward at all. Even in the upper atmosphere, where there’s still some air, if the air is too thin it’s like trying to get a big pushback by pushing your arm into a hanging curtain—it won’t work well.

On the other hand, if you deflated a balloon in space, the balloon would shoot backward—in the same way it would on Earth—because the force in that situation isn’t created by pushing on air outside the balloon (like a propeller), it’s created by the air pressure being much higher inside the balloon than outside of it and the air being forced out of the balloon by the pressure difference. In fact, if you were floating around in the middle of space and had an air-filled balloon, you could move yourself a bit by deflating the balloon in the opposite direction—and for those few seconds while the balloon was deflating, the balloon would be an engine.

The engines at the bottom of Falcon 9 are just more powerful deflating balloons. A fiery explosion creates extremely high temperature and pressure, which makes the exploding gas want to rapidly expand into the lower-pressure space all around it. And if something blows up in the middle of an empty field, it can expand outward in all directions but down:6

A rocket engine creates an explosion that wants to do the same thing—but the engine, like the balloon, won’t let the force move outward in any direction except one. And being “rejected” from all the other directions just adds to the force:7

1536px-Rocket_thrust.svg

So that’s why rocket engines work in a vacuum. They don’t need anything external, like air, to push down on—by expelling a mass of hot gas, they’re essentially pushing down on that.

Musk would love to have a better way than exploding fuel to power rockets, but he’s not sure we’ll ever find one. I asked him about it, and he said, “For rockets to go electric, there would have to be a few Nobel Prizes awarded.”

The Merlin

Falcon 1’s ascent was entirely propelled by one ragingly powerful SpaceX-invented engine, called the Merlin.8

merlin

Merlins are rad. One Merlin engine has a thrust of over 73 tons—i.e. it can lift 73 tons of weight—which means if you stacked 40 cars on top of the engine in that picture, it could lift the whole stack into space in about three minutes. It’s one of the most2 efficient, advanced engines in the world. An important statistic in the rocket engine world is thrust-to-weight ratio—i.e. how many times its own weight it can lift. Weighing about a half ton and peaking at over an 80-ton thrust, the Merlin’s ratio is 165:1, which blows away all other engines like it. Here’s a Merlin test firing:



How intense is that shit.3

Now imagine nine of them firing together. That’s what happens during each Falcon 9 launch—the rocket’s name comes from the nine engines, which are arranged in an “octaweb”:9

spacex-falcon-9-octaweb

Together, the nine Merlins generate 650 tons of thrust, enough to shoot a stack of 360 cars into space (a stack that would be the height of One World Trade Center), and they burn through a combined 540 gallons (2,044 L) of fuel every second—enough to drain a swimming pool in less than a minute. Most of what the engines end up lifting is the rocket and its fuel, which weigh in at a combined 550 tons, but there’s still plenty of leftover muscle to add a sizable payload on top.

The Second Stage

Three minutes after launching, the first and second stages separate:10

3725738_orig

The first stage falls back to Earth, and it’s now the second stage’s big moment to shine. The second stage is just a mini version of the first stage, and it’s also mostly filled with fuel. But instead of nine Merlin engines, the second stage only has one—a special version made to be used in the vacuum of space, with a bell extension to increase its thrust. Fewer engines are needed here because A) no more thick atmosphere, B) it’s lifting a lot less weight without the first stage attached, and C) it’s already going really fast so much of the work is done.

The second stage’s job can be over in a few minutes or last multiple hours. Its engine can go off and on, and it has directional maneuverability. Its job is to be precise and get the payload to the exact right location and velocity. Once it does that, it separates from the payload and drops off:11

057_Dragon_separation_640

Speaking of payload, there are two ways the top of a Falcon 9 can look, and the difference is which type of payload it’s bringing with it. Here’s the first way:12

falcon 9

When it looks like this, it’s usually carrying a satellite. The bulge at the top is a two-piece protective clamshell thing called a fairing. It tends to look about the size of a bathtub, but it’s actually the size of a school bus:13

1226813766899731014

Once the second stage gets going at a certain speed (about four times the speed of a bullet), the fairing’s two halves separate and fall back into the atmosphere to burn up.14

Screen Shot 2015-07-29 at 7.05.03 PM

The second way the top of a Falcon 9 can look is this:15

falcon9-render-1

 

The more triangle-looking top means the rocket is carrying a Dragon spacecraft.

Dragon16

space_x_dragon_in_orbit

SUV-sized Dragon is SpaceX’s spacecraft, made for transporting cargo, and one day people, to and from space. NASA’s big 2008 contract with SpaceX was for 12 Dragon missions to the ISS. In the picture above, the cone-shaped thing on the right half is the Dragon’s pressurized capsule and the only thing that returns to Earth. The cylindrical part on the left is an unpressurized trunk, which can carry additional cargo and holds the solar panels (which is what gives Dragon power in space). Together, the two can hold around six tons of cargo.

Those little holes on the side are mini thruster engines Dragon uses to maneuver in space, and on its bottom is a heat shield for re-entry.

Falcon 9 starts its career

As all of this new equipment was in development, Falcon 1 made its fifth and final launch in the summer of 2009, launching a satellite for the Malaysian government—SpaceX’s first paying customer, and successful launch #2. But with the taller and more handsome Falcon 9 in the womb, Falcon 1 wouldn’t be needed anymore, and it was retired.

Falcon 1 had made its five launches from a tiny Pacific island called Kwajalein Atoll. But having joined the big boys club with Falcon 9, SpaceX took out leases at America’s prime time launch pads—Vandenberg Air Force Base in California (for launches to the south) and legendary Cape Canaveral in Florida (for launches to the east).

And in the summer of 2010, the first Falcon 9 headed off for the launch pad, causing thousands of highway-drivers to say, “What the hell is that?”17

s

Its inaugural voyage—a demo run—was a success.

Then, SpaceX started doing things commercial companies aren’t supposed to know how to do.

Sending a spacecraft out to space is hard—but bringing it back might be even harder. You know how if you jump into the ocean off of a dock, nothing bad happens (except the water being probably freezing because everyone likes to pretend that immersing yourself in cold water is an okay activity)—but if you jump into the ocean off of a bridge, you die? With the only difference being your body’s velocity when it hits the water? Same situation with the Earth’s atmosphere.

You don’t feel the atmosphere right now because of your minimal velocity, but open your hand and vigorously move your arm back and forth like a psycho and you can feel the atmosphere. Speed yourself up even more by riding in a convertible or a fast-moving boat and you’re quickly pummeled in the face by the atmosphere. But the speed isn’t just about you. It’s about your speed relative to the speed of the atmosphere. Putting your hand out the window in a car going 50 mph feels the same as putting your hand out the window of a parked car with 50 mph winds outside. So when an object in orbit—which we established earlier has to be traveling at about 17,000 mph (27,300 km/h)—decides it’s over it and tries to come back to Earth, it experiences the equivalent of a 17,000 mph hurricane. Our official hurricane “levels” go from category 1 (74-95 mph) to category 5 (which starts at 155 mph), going up a level roughly for every 20 mph increase in wind speeds. At ground level, moving 17,000 mph would be like hanging out in a category 842 hurricane. The force of a category 842 hurricane would be lower in the thin atmosphere at the high altitudes where objects first enter—but still.

What scares us about hurricanes is their force. But in a category [three-digit number] hurricane, you have much bigger problems. The spacecraft’s blistering speed in the upper atmosphere means the air in front of an incoming capsule doesn’t have time to “get out of the way” and becomes super-compressed and blazingly hot. Lower, where the atmosphere is thicker, the spacecraft has to handle the heat of the intense atmospheric drag. Rocks can’t handle it—which is why they turn into shooting stars—and building a spacecraft that can requires a lot of fancy technology.

Up until 2010, only five governments had ever managed to get a spacecraft out into space and recover it successfully. Falcon 9’s second launch pinged the first Dragon into orbit on a demo run for the new spacecraft, and after two orbits, Dragon came barreling through a category 842 hurricane and still existed on the other side, making SpaceX the first company, and sixth entity of any kind, to recover an orbiting spacecraft. Not bad for a company on their seventh launch.

Falcon 9’s third launch made history again, when on a demo mission for NASA, Dragon became the first commercial spacecraft to attach to the ISS.418

17_dragongrappled_full

SpaceX made a little triumphant video with the highlights.

Falcon 9 was the real deal. Vance writes, “Where the Falcon 1 blasting off from Kwajalein was the work of a start-up, the Falcon 9 taking off from Vandenberg is the work of an aerospace superpower.”19 And with two of three planned demo missions done, NASA had seen enough to scratch the third demo mission and get started with the official resupply missions to the ISS on Dragon.

If you’re curious what a launch is actually like, here’s a video of mission CRS-6, an ISS resupply mission that launched out of Cape Canaveral on April 14, 2015:



Things to note:

The plumes of white smoke coming out of the rocket before launch is oxygen from the liquid oxygen tank in the rocket as some of it escapes as gas.
About five seconds before liftoff, a deluge system called “Niagara” starts flooding the launch site with water. The purpose of this is to muffle the deafening sound of the engines, because otherwise, the sound waves would be so powerful that they’d actually damage the rocket.
The engines start firing a couple seconds before liftoff. What’s happening is that huge clamps are holding the rocket down as the engines fire so a computer can quickly test them to make sure they’re all working. If they are, the clamps release at T-0 and the rocket takes off.
Timing is critical down to the second. Even one second off schedule will mess up the rendezvous with the ISS.
Launches are hectic.
Over the first three minutes, the bright orange stream of delicious fire coming out of the rocket becomes increasingly spread out, icky-looking, and gray. This is because as the altitude increases, atmospheric oxygen thins out, and combustion has a harder and harder time taking place outside the rocket.
The first stage separates at 3:26.
After stage separation, the big black bell you’re looking at is the second stage’s sole Merlin engine. You can’t see any fire coming out of the engine because combustion is impossible at that altitude so it immediately stops after leaving the engine.
Nothing much happens for the next seven minutes.
At 11:09, the rocket is sufficiently in orbit and the second stage separates.
Most of the rest of the video is a view of the now on-its-own Dragon taken by a camera on the second stage.
In the last 25 seconds of the video, you can see the Dragon’s solar panels unfold.
After five Falcon 1 launches and three Falcon 9 launches, most of which were tests and demos, SpaceX was ready to start its space delivery service. Falcon 9’s fourth launch and the first official ISS resupply mission was the first in a string of 15 straight successful deliveries (six Dragon missions for NASA, nine satellite missions for other customers), bringing us to May of 2015, when I wrote this sentence and accidentally jinxed the whole company:

Since their first three failed launches, SpaceX has launched 20 times—all successes.

And after that 20th straight success, Musk tweeted, “Rocket launch good, satellite in geo transfer orbit. Still so damn intense. Looking fwd to it feeling normal one day.”

Then—on the very next launch—this happened:20

ezgif.com-optimize

A launch failure is a horrible thing, even when no people are involved. It’s why SpaceX VP Mark Juncosa told me that each launch day is constant, torturous anxiety. It seems kind of like a pitcher throwing a pitch with two outs in the ninth inning of game 7 of the World Series, except the ball takes a few months to get to the plate, and they have to watch the moment when it finally gets to the batter on TV.

But devastating failures are part of what you sign up for when you get into the space game. After the demoralizing third failure of Falcon 1, Musk wrote to his employees, “It is perhaps worth noting that those launch companies that succeeded also took their lumps along the way. A friend of mine wrote to remind me that only 5 of the first 9 Pegasus launches succeeded; 3 of 5 for Ariane; 9 of 20 for Atlas; 9 of 21 for Soyuz; and 9 of 18 for Proton. SpaceX is in this for the long haul and, come hell or high water, we are going to make this work.” This puts SpaceX’s June 2015 failure in perspective and lets it serve more as a reminder of how impressive its 20 for 24 start has been.

The good news about failures is they show you exactly where your weak points are. In this failure, the culprit was a single two-foot long, one-inch thick steel bar—one of hundreds in the rocket—that was supposed to handle five tons of force and snapped after only one. From now on, SpaceX will individually test every steel bar that goes into a rocket. You can see Dragon slip away unscathed (at the top of the screen, toward the beginning), and if it had software to deploy its parachutes earlier than planned, the contents in it would have survived. From now on, Dragon will have that software.

And that brings us to today.

In an industry full of middleman price hikes and decades-old equipment, SpaceX’s tightly controlled in-house supply chain and cutting edge technology has made it the world’s cheapest option for space delivery. For years, the US government has relied on two major aerospace companies—Boeing and Lockheed Martin, along with their joint venture, United Launch Alliance (ULA)—for domestic launches. ULA charges the government—and the US taxpayers—$380 million per launch. For a similar launch, the US government only pays SpaceX $133 million. For launches with other customers, without all of NASA’s special requirements, SpaceX charges $60 million per launch.

Given the unbelievable bargain, SpaceX unsurprisingly has a long line of customers vying for their services—they currently have a backlog of over 50 planned launches, worth over $5 billion. They’re doing everything they can to ramp up production, aiming to soon make 40 Falcon 9s a year. Musk believes that within a few years, SpaceX will cost less than a tenth of the industry average, and he believes SpaceX can take over the majority of the world’s commercial launches.

This is a big deal for the US, not just SpaceX.

The US, through Boeing, is proud to be one of two major airplane producers (with Europe’s Airbus being the other), but for some reason, the country has allowed itself to become an insignificant part of the global launch industry—while Europe, Russia, and China dominate. The main provider of US launches, ULA, gets most of its business from the US government, and gets the most expensive part of its hardware equipment—the engines—by buying them from Russia. SpaceX is making the US a big player in the launch industry again as business increasingly pours in from all around the world—and they manufacture almost everything domestically.

More Angry Giants

While SpaceX might be a terrific development for both Americans and the future of space travel, not everyone is so pleased about their arrival on the scene.

Remember last post when we took a deep look into what’s going on under the hood of the auto and oil/gas industries, and it turns out it’s all pretty messed up and humanity is kind of being taken for a ride without realizing it? Because that’s what happens when opaque industries have a “special” relationship with the government and barriers to entry that keep out competition from underdogs? And how Tesla is kind of exposing all of that and forcing a fat, happy, and docile industry to innovate, and how they all desperately wish Musk would disappear?

I could almost just copy and paste that section into this post as well.

The space launch industry is like a handful of auto mechanics in a small town that all charge about ten times as much as they need to, but because A) customers are clueless about the process and what it should cost, and B) all the competition overcharges as well, there’s no incentive to upgrade equipment, increase efficiency, and bring down costs. SpaceX is like a newcomer to town who sets up an auto shop, comes up with newer, better ways to fix cars, works harder than anyone else, and is able to charge a fraction of the price for the same service. Which ruins everything for the town’s other auto mechanics.

In 2014, Europe’s Arianespace—a major player in the global launch industry—asked European governments for additional subsidies to handle competition from SpaceX. A Falcon 9 trip to GTO (the highest satellite orbit) now costs $15 million less than a launch on China’s historically-cheap Long March rocket. As for the other major player in the launch market, Musk has said, “My family fears that the Russians will assassinate me.”21

All around the world, launch customers are noticing what SpaceX is doing, then looking at their own launch company and asking, “Wait why am I paying so much?”

When I asked Musk about all the industries that want to drop a piano on his head, he said, “It’s a roomful of toes—it’s hard to avoid stepping on them.” And of all the toes SpaceX is currently stepping on, it’s stepping the hardest on ULA.

ULA is a Dick Blue Box

ULA, the Boeing and Lockheed joint venture, charges more than anyone for a space launch. But it doesn’t matter what they charge. ULA doesn’t have to compete with the rest of the world’s launch market—because ULA gets a constant flow of automatic business from the US military. Here’s how it works:

1) The US military needs to launch a lot of things into space, so there’s plenty of business.

2) Because military equipment is tied to national security, the US wants the launches done by an American company.

3) Because space launching, like auto repair, is an opaque process to the public and to politicians, no one knows that ULA’s launch price tag is much higher than it needs to be.

4) ULA works with the government on a “cost plus basis,” meaning their payment for a launch is a percentage of whatever the launch costs them—i.e. they’re incentivized to make it cost more, not less.

5) There’s ample money to go around because of the US’s astronomical military budget.

6) Most infuriatingly, many of the decision-makers in the US Department of Defense are friends with the leadership of ULA, and ULA is a common place for DoD officials to work when they retire from government. So ULA is more likely to get a nod and a wink from the DoD than an audit into how they spend their money.

What that all adds up to is at best, a flawed system that puts zero pressure on lowering costs and at worst, a grand-scale government scandal—all paid for by the US taxpayer.

And do you know what a ULA-DoD circle jerk really doesn’t want around? A company like SpaceX. SpaceX had succeeded in winning much of NASA’s business, but in order to be awarded a military launch contract, a company needs special certification, and curiously, SpaceX had a very hard time becoming certified. Calling bullshit on the process, and knowing that the law requires there to be fair competition for the military’s launching needs, in 2014 Musk brought the issue to Congress, making the case that “SpaceX is not seeking to be awarded contracts for these launches. We are simply seeking the right to compete.”22

But he received a lot of pushback. Despite clear evidence that ULA charges six times SpaceX’s rate per pound of payload, politicians like Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama (one of whose biggest donors is the aerospace industry23) argued that it was a national security issue—an odd line of argument, considering that ULA pours money into Russia, buying their engines and other parts, while SpaceX does all of their business in the US. In an interview a few months ago, Musk vented about the situation: “ULA has decided that they’re afraid even of an unfair competition. They don’t want a fair competition. They don’t even want an unfair competition. They want no competition at all…they’re afraid that we’ll take some of the huge gravy train they have exclusive access to, or that it’s not going to be as big.”

SpaceX has made some progress in the last year and has been awarded a small number of military launches, but only a tiny fraction—this is a battle SpaceX will be fighting for a while. I asked Musk about the difficulty of competing against ULA. His response: “These are not pushovers, it’s the military-industrial complex. You know in movies, how they do terrible things? Well yeah, those guys.”

The SpaceX revenue model will be growing and expanding in the coming years. Here are three of the coolest things in the pipeline:

1) Falcon Heavy

Remember how I made a whole big deal about putting nine Merlins together and being able to lift a skyscraper-high stack of 360 cars? Falcon Heavy is a Falcon 9 except instead of having one first stage, it has three.24

falcon_heavy.3k

With 27 Merlins, the Falcon Heavy engine platform can lift about 2,000 tons, or a mile-high, 1,100-car stack. Launching for the first time in 2016, Falcon Heavy will be able to take more than double the payload of any other rocket in the world—and do so at the lowest price per pound of payload in history (ULA charges three times what Falcon Heavy will charge per launch and will take less than half the payload). Here’s a little payload comparison of the industry’s most heavy-duty rockets:

fhgraphic

2) Quadrupling the number of satellites in orbit

Actually though. A couple months ago, Musk announced that SpaceX would be starting a satellite-production operation in Seattle that would put 4,000 internet satellites in Low Earth Orbit by 2030—three times the 1,300 total satellites that are in orbit today. His reasons:

Bring costs down to bring technology up. Today, it typically costs about a quarter billion dollars to make a satellite and around the same amount to put it in space. That makes every satellite launch super high stakes, which makes companies risk-averse, so they tend to use older, proven technology and make sure to get at least 15 or more years of usage out of each one. The result is that a lot of the satellites performing services for us today were made in 1990, with 25-year-old technology. SpaceX wants to figure out how to make satellites for a much lower cost, and combined with their ability to launch much more cheaply, they’ll be able to put cutting-edge satellites in orbit, do so frequently, and replace them just as frequently.
Bring internet to anyone, anywhere. I sat down with Rajeev Badyal, SpaceX’s VP of Avionics Engineering, who is in charge of the satellite project. He explained that SpaceX’s constellation of 4,000 solar-powered satellites will work together intelligently to cover every part of the Earth and beam lightning-fast internet to places where it’s badly needed. He talked about how really only a few places on Earth (Europe, the US, parts of India and East Asia, etc.) are truly blanketed with good internet, and how this would be a game-changer for many other parts of the world, especially the most remote. All you’d need to make it work is a small, pizza-box shaped receiver, which could be put anywhere outside, and you could have fast internet on the North Pole, the middle of the Pacific Ocean, the top of Mount Everest—anywhere. He also talked about other ways the satellites could be used—you could attach cameras to them to use for crime reports, live Google Maps, weather—anything.
Even more angry giants. Wouldn’t Time Warner Cable and Comcast be a great addition to the pile of big, low-quality, monopoly-like companies Musk is finding a way to compete with? In his announcement, Musk mentioned it: “In cases where people are stuck with Time Warner or Comcast, this would provide an opportunity to leave.” (This got a huge cheer from the crowd.)
It’s lucrative. Between selling satellites it manufactures and creating revenue off of those it puts in orbit, SpaceX can make a ton of money from this.
Solves the Mars internet problem. Physical cables are the way of the past and Mars will be a planet of the future. Musk plans to have SpaceX-manufactured internet satellites circling Mars down the road, bringing fast internet to the future Mars colony.
3) Manned Space Travel

In 2014, the US and Russia got mad at each other, as they are wont to do—this time over Russia deciding that it would actually be super cool if Crimea were part of Russia—and the US responded by imposing sanctions against Russia’s space program. To which the Russian Deputy Prime Minister tweeted:

After reviewing the sanctions against our space industry, I suggest that the United States deliver their astronauts to the ISS using a trampoline.

Well played.

This is what happens when your once mighty space program becomes so lame that it can’t launch its own astronauts into space anymore. You have to rely on countries you might get mad at, which puts you in a terrible position.

The only other country that can launch people into space is China, and the US is even madder at them—so mad that Chinese astronauts are prohibited from hanging out at the cool kids’ club on the ISS. It’s like a town with three rival mob bosses, but awkwardly, only two of them have a car, so the third needs to get a ride to work with one of the others. Not ideal for the third boss.

Elon Musk chimed in with his own tweet soon after:

Sounds like this might be a good time to unveil the new Dragon Mk 2 spaceship that @SpaceX has been working on w @NASA. No trampoline needed
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 29, 2014
The Space Shuttle program retired in 2011, starting this window we’re in where the US has no way to perform manned space flight. The next Space Shuttle-style full US space program is supposed to be the creatively-named Space Launch System and its Orion spacecraft, but delays have pushed the program’s commencement back to at least 2021. The US doesn’t want to rely on Russia until 2021, so in the meantime, NASA held a contest to choose private contractors to use for crewed launches. NASA ended up splitting up the $6.8 billion contract between Boeing (who would get $4.2 billion) and SpaceX (who would get $2.6 billion).525

In May of 2014, SpaceX unveiled the second iteration of Dragon—Dragon 2.26

dragon v2

The first Dragon is cool—it’s one of the only spacecraft that can return to Earth intact, and it’s currently the world’s only operational spacecraft that can bring cargo back from the ISS.6 But Dragon 2 is much cooler.

Dragon 2 can dock with the ISS without being pulled in by the ISS’s arm like an infant.

Dragon 2 has seats inside and fancy touch screens (most of today’s spacecraft were designed in the 60s and still have buttons and knobs like an old radio):27

5_dragonv2

But the coolest thing about Dragon 2 are its engines. The spacecraft has eight super-powerful little engines, called SuperDracos, each of which could lift four cars. SuperDracos are so specifically designed that they’re entirely manufactured by 3D printing, the first rocket engines to be made that way. I’m going to embed another engine-firing video, because it’s so fun to watch. Here’s a SuperDraco being tested:



Dragon 2’s SuperDracos have three main purposes:

1) Maneuvering in space

2) Propulsive landing – more on this in the next section

3) To abort the astronauts if something goes wrong

The third is a critical feature for crew safety. Even the best rockets sometimes fail, often in catastrophic fashion—as SpaceX just demonstrated for us—and Dragon 2’s abort system allows the spacecraft to get the hell away from the scene before the bomb goes off. If the two Space Shuttle disasters had had this feature, the astronauts might have been saved. Here’s a recent test showing Dragon 2’s abort system in action, which for some reason struck me as kind of adorable:



The power of the abort is hard to fully grasp in that video. The eight SuperDracos are so powerful that they take the Dragon more than the length of a football field in two seconds, and over a third of a mile (about half a km) in just over five seconds. And while other manned capsules have had abort capabilities before, the others have only been able to abort during launch—Dragon 2’s abort system works all the way up to orbit.

Musk also wants to redefine what it means to be an astronaut, explaining that a person shouldn’t have to be an astronaut to fly in space. His vision has ordinary people hopping on top of a SpaceX rocket and going to space with relatively little training or skills—the same way we fly in planes today (kind of reminds me of how at one point, only a computer scientist could use a computer, and how outdated that concept seems today). Following the theme of acknowledging that it’s 2015, not 1965, SpaceX is also redoing the concept of the spacesuit—Musk has specifically insisted they be cool looking and ditch the Marshmallow Man style.

The timetable has the first SpaceX and Boeing manned flights launching in 2017—but there’s currently a push in the US Senate to slash NASA’s funding, which would delay things by at least two years. Nahhh.

So that’s what SpaceX does and how it makes money. The delivery service is doing its job—SpaceX is profitable and should have a long runway ahead to stay afloat. A recent investment by Google and Fidelity valued the company at $12 billion.

But Musk has said that his nightmare would be for SpaceX to end up in the hands of someone who will milk it for short-term profit. Because as we laid out at the beginning of this Phase 2 section, everything we just discussed is what SpaceX does—but not what SpaceX really does.

What SpaceX really does has been happening ever since the development of Falcon 1 and is evidenced by the unbelievable deal you can currently get to deliver something to space on a Falcon 9 versus any other way.

But SpaceX’s low prices would still be classified as an incremental improvement—not a transformative game-changer.

What SpaceX is really doing is something much, much bigger—they’re working on an innovation so groundbreaking that if they can pull it off, they’ll reduce the cost of launching a rocket by 100 times more and completely alter humanity’s future in space—and make a multi-planetary future possible.

Changing the Game

Remember this whole thing from before?

Venn3

Musk estimates that $500,000 for a ticket to Mars might be the magic number that makes the blue circle big enough that the green zone reaches a million people. The way he describes it, with a $500,000 ticket, it would be like buying a middle-class home in California, and “most people in advanced countries, in their mid-forties or something like that, could put together enough money to make the trip.”28

So how close are we? In 1989, when Bush Sr. proposed an initiative to bring US astronauts to Mars, NASA estimated it would cost $450 billion. To send 4-6 astronauts. About $100 billion per seat.29

Close. Just 200,000 times Musk’s per-seat goal of $500,000.

In 2004, Bush Jr. entertained the idea of sending Americans to Mars. NASA said it would cost $50 billion. $10 billion a seat. Still 20,000 times too high.

So how the hell do you bring the price of anything down 20,000 times.

Musk’s plan is to attack the problem from two angles.

1) Bring lots of people

The Falcon rocket family is SpaceX’s moneymaker, but neither Falcon nor Dragon will ever take people to Mars.

For one, Dragon is the size of an SUV—going to Mars takes three months at the very least. Not a good plan.

Secondly, if you’re gonna go all the way to Mars, you should make it a big carpool.

That’s why SpaceX has a long term plan to build a rocket that will make Falcon 9 look like a hot dog—

The Mars Colonial Transporter.

The MCT rocket will be a giant, powered by a much more powerful SpaceX engine, called the Raptor, that’s currently in the works—and its spacecraft will be able to hold at least 100 people.

So right there, if SpaceX can do that, they’ve cut the current cost-per-seat estimates by at least 20.

Now we’re down to this being 1,000 times too expensive.

But there’s another thing—SpaceX has, through its Falcon innovations, already reduced the cost of a launch to one-fifth of the industry standard, and Musk believes it’ll be down to a tenth of the industry standard in the coming years. Since the Bush Jr. figure was assuming industry standard costs, that brings things down to only 100 times too expensive.

A bigger spacecraft can help lower the per-seat cost of going to Mars, but it doesn’t change anything for today’s commercial launch industry, it doesn’t get us anywhere close to cheap enough to bring large numbers of people to Mars, and it doesn’t solve what Musk calls “the fundamental problem with space exploration.”

So what is this big game-changing innovation I keep hyping up but not telling you about?

2) Reusability

Imagine the current air travel industry with one key difference: an airplane works for one flight only. Each flight is on a brand new plane, and after the flight, passengers exit into the terminal and the plane is broken down into scrap metal and possibly-reusable parts that are sent off to be refurbished for use in a future plane.

An airplane costs around $300 million to build. So in this new model, in addition to paying for the crew’s time and fuel, airlines have to spend $300 million extra each flight to build a plane. How would that change things?

First, there would be very few flights available—the schedule would be limited by the pace of plane production. Second, the price of a round-trip ticket between Chicago and San Francisco would now cost about $1.5 million per person. For economy.

Air Force One would still exist. Wealthy countries would have a small military air fleet. A few governments would fly in order to perform certain types of science experiments. People with 10 billion dollars would probably fly a decent amount, but people with only one billion dollars couldn’t really afford it. And you? You would be born, live your life, and die without ever riding on a plane.

If this were the situation, people would probably look at the non-existent air travel industry and determine that clearly, there was no public will to travel by air. Politicians would argue against putting much government funding into the exorbitant activity. Most people wouldn’t even fully understand how airplanes worked, and they wouldn’t waste any time imagining what the world would be like if everyone could use them. It would become a non-topic. We’d travel by car and railroad and ship and that would be that.

Can you see where I’m going with this?

No one in history—not the US, not the Soviets, and certainly not the stagnant fat cats at ULA—has figured out how to make rockets reusable. Rockets spend months getting built, head up to space, and either burn up in the atmosphere or crash into the ocean as scrap metal. It’s not that no one has tried—the US and Soviets have both put tens of billions of dollars into the problem—it’s that no one has figured it out.

The Space Shuttle system was supposedly “reusable.” But there are three parts of a Space Shuttle—the spacecraft, which was genuinely reusable, the rockets, which were technically reusable but took nine months of refurbishment that nullified the cost benefits, and the big orange gas tank, which was totally unreusable and converted to immediate trash after the launch. So it was 1 for 3, and as a result, Space Shuttle missions cost a laughable $1.6 billion apiece (over $200 million per astronaut).

A bigger spacecraft, coupled with SpaceX’s cost-saving innovations, has theoretically brought things to within two orders of magnitude of the goal—$50 million per person. And that cost assumes a new MCT would have to be built for every flight.

The first game for SpaceX was figuring out how to launch something into orbit. Now they’re onto a new, much harder game—reusability. If SpaceX can create what they call “a fully and rapidly reusable rocket system”—leaving the only launch costs as fuel, maintenance, and interior support systems, just like an airplane—it’ll reduce the cost of space travel by a factor of 100. Maybe more.

So how do you do it?

First, you need a better way to land. Musk describes the three ways a rocket and spacecraft can land:

Landing Type 1 (most basic): Parachuting into the ocean

This is how almost all spacecraft land today, if they land at all.

Problems: Parachutes don’t work in places with no air, like the moon; landing in corrosive salt-water heavily damages the equipment; it’s undignified (imagine an alien trying to be intimidating by landing in our ocean with parachutes and having to swim to shore).

Landing Type 2 (intermediate): Wings and wheels onto a runway

This is how the Space Shuttle landed.

Problems: Wings don’t work in places with no air, like the moon,7 or no runways, like everywhere besides Earth; while this method can be used for a spacecraft, it’s much harder to do with the rocket—and full reusability means landing both the spacecraft and the rocket stages.

Landing Type 3 (advanced): Propulsive landing

Propulsive landing means coming down the same way rockets take off. This is how the Apollo Lunar Modules (like Apollo 11’s “Eagle”) landed on the moon.

Propulsive landing allows you to land a rocket or spacecraft neatly on a landing platform, with minimal damage to the vehicle.

It’s easier to envision a spacecraft doing a propulsive landing than a rocket doing one, because we’ve seen spacecraft do it before. Dragon 2 is being designed to be a landing specialist—those same SuperDraco engines Dragon 2 uses to abort in an emergency will also be used to land, and Dragon will be able to land on any type of surface of any solid body in the Solar System as easily as a helicopter can land on Earth. Landing a rocket that way is a more foreign concept, and much more difficult.

Here’s SpaceX’s vision for Falcon and Dragon reusability—worth the watch:



If it works, the idea is that a rocket and spacecraft could land, be refueled, and head back up within hours. Again—just like an airplane.

Juncosa explained to me that the first and most important step is to learn how to land just the Falcon’s first stage. It’s the most important because the first stage costs about as much to build as a jumbo jet and makes up the bulk of the rocket’s total cost (especially the engines)—if they succeed at that, it’ll be a giant step forward. And they’ll show the world, including the currently-very-skeptical aerospace industry, that reusability is indeed possible. They’ll have drawn a blueprint for how other rocket-makers can slash their own costs—and begun a new era in space travel.

This is how landing the first stage is supposed go (click for a larger view):30

spacex

When it says “burn,” it means that a single main engine fires (the one in the middle). Since weight is such a factor during launches (there’s almost no room for added weight or the rocket won’t be able to get a payload into orbit), the rocket will have enough fuel for exactly three burns. The first is used to stop the rocket’s ballistic path (i.e. the normal arc it’s naturally on) and direct it toward the landing site.8 The second is used to slow down—from 3,000 mph to 550 mph (885 km/h)—so it doesn’t burn up in the atmosphere. The third is used right above the landing platform, to slow it down to 5 mph (8 km/h).

Since weather is moving and unpredictable, there’s a lot of software in the rocket sensing outside forces and adjusting the trajectory. The rocket has little wing flaps called “grid fins” that open up and steer the rocket (the grid fins and landing legs also slow down the rocket, cutting the terminal velocity in half). Grid fins work when you’re in the atmosphere, but up in space where there’s no air, grid fins are useless, so the rocket steers with ejections from “cold gas thrusters”—little nitrogen jets that come out of the rocket.

If all works according to plan, about nine minutes after launch, the rocket will land on this floating platform in the ocean, 200 miles out from the launch pad:931

17127808431_5ccfd017cd_z

This is hard. If you scale down all the sizes, it’s like firing a pencil over the top of a skyscraper and trying to land it on a shoe box on the ground—on a windy day. SpaceX likens the challenge of controlling the descent through the atmosphere to “trying to balance a rubber broomstick on your hand in the middle of a wind storm.” Popular Mechanics calls it “a tense juggling act, where any one of thousands of moving parts can push the entire system into mayhem. If the rocket does land softly on the barge, it’s because millions of insanely detailed self-adjustments have kept the Falcon 9’s composure as it dove through chaos.”

To hone its skills, SpaceX created a first stage rocket they call Grasshopper. In 2012, they were able to launch Grasshopper to the height of a 12-story building, pause it there for a few seconds, and then bring it back down to the pad:



Over the next two years, they launched Grasshopper higher and higher until finally launching a real Falcon 9 first stage a kilometer in the air and returning it to the platform.

Finally, it was time to try it for real—on an actual launch. In January of 2015, SpaceX performed a routine launch and brought the first stage through the atmosphere and tried to land it. Here’s what happened (kind of fun with sound):



Close! Ish! That’s what the people at SpaceX call an RUD—a rapid unscheduled disassembly.

They were going to try again with the next launch, in February, but it was scratched because of weather. They finally got a second chance to try in April, and this happened (the video is sped up):32

tumblr_nmv88lYshZ1qbeh7ko1_250

Just…almost…got it…but then the rocket tipped over like an asshole and exploded instead.

The third attempt was supposed to be in June…but we all know what happened in June.

So if you’re just tuning in to all of this now, consider yourself lucky that it hasn’t happened yet. You can start following now and see it live when they first make history (the best way I’ve found to stay oriented about the SpaceX launch schedule is on this Wikipedia page, and the best way to keep up with major developments and find the link to live launch webcasts is by following SpaceX on Twitter). There should be several more attempts in 2015. If history is an indicator, once SpaceX nails it once, they’ll probably be able to nail it every time.

UPDATE: On December 21, 2015, SpaceX launched for the first time since the June ’15 failure. Not only did the mission go perfectly (to deliver 11 satellites to orbit), they landed the rocket successfully. They did it. I was lucky enough to be at SpaceX headquarters to watch it happen (I was guest co-hosting the webcast), and it was the most excited I’ve seen a room of 1,000+ people ever. Here’s the full webcast (launch happens at about 23:00 and landing excitement starts at about 31:00).

As I was researching for this post, just to make sure Musk was for real about this $500,000 for a ticket to Mars thing, I sent him an email laying out the logic as I saw it, to see if it’s really what he was thinking. Here was his response:

Yeah, these are seemingly absurd percentage improvements, however not impossible. The critical elements of the solution are rocket reusability and low cost propellant (CH4 and O2 at an O/F ratio of ~3.8). And, of course, making the return propellant on Mars, which has a handy CO2 atmosphere and lots of H2O frozen in the soil.

The design goal is technically 100+ metric tons of useful cargo per flight, so maybe more than 100 people can be taken. Depends on how much support mass is needed per person and the luggage allowable.

Avionics, sensors, communications, aspects of vehicle structure, landing pads and a few other things get better with scale, plus it is more fun to be on a cruise ship than a bus, so I suspect that the 100 people per flight number grows a lot over time, maybe to several hundred. Also, we could subsidize the equivalent of economy by charging a lot more for first class.

Factor in all of the above and getting below $100k/ton or person eventually is conceivable, as the trip cost is then dominated by propellant, which is mostly liquid oxygen at a mere $40/ton (although a lot of it is needed per useful ton of cargo). That would be really awesome!

Just an affordable cruise ship to Mars nbd.10

Making that possible is the job of Phase 2, and SpaceX seems to be on their way to getting it done—possibly in the next decade. Once they get there, they’ll be able to start the final phase of their mission—the one that will change everything.

Phase 3: Colonize Mars

Main Character: The Mars Colonial Transporter

Goal: Put 1,000,000 people on Mars

SpaceX Business Plan 3

Today, no one is talking about Mars, and very few people think of Mars as a relevant part of the near future. But unless I’ve missed something big or something unexpected happens, in about 10–20 years, people will start going to Mars. You could go to Mars in your lifetime. Crazy things are on the horizon.

This is one of those topics that’s tough to absorb, because as you think about it, your mind will keep drifting back to, “Nahhhh.” Learning about what SpaceX is doing and why they’re doing it can take you from a place where thinking the prospect of humans moving to Mars is totally ludicrous to a place where you accept the logic that it’s actually an important thing to do and something that’s possible and even likely to happen. But that’s different than really believing it’ll happen. As you read this post, even if you agree with what you’re reading, if you had to quickly bet $1,000 on whether people will be moving to Mars in 20 years, there’s a good chance you’d bet against it, because deep down, your brain hasn’t really accepted it. And that’s fair—your brain bases things on experience, and experience tells it that moving to Mars is not something that people ever do.

But I’m pretty sure your brain’s in for some big surprises over the next few decades, for a bunch of reasons, and if you’re willing to accept that possibility, try to absorb the fact that a section titled “Phase 3: Colonize Mars” might actually—really—be based in reality.

Everything from here on is based on the guesswork of Musk and others in the field. Here’s those people’s best crack at predicting how this will all play out:

Before anything with people starts, there will be a preliminary phase where SpaceX sends spacecraft to Mars without any people. The first step, Musk told me, would be to “send an automated spaceship to Mars just to make sure you can send something there and back”—this should happen before 2020. Then, there would be a handful of unmanned cargo missions to bring equipment, habitats, and supplies, so that when the first people start arriving, they’ll be able to not die—they’ll need access to water, a place to live, the tools to convert compounds on Mars to oxygen, fertilizer to grow crops, etc.1

Then something big will happen. Someone—probably SpaceX, probably in about ten years—will send the first crew of people to Mars. For anyone under the age of 50 who’s annoyed they weren’t alive and sentient in 1969 to get caught up in the excitement of the moon landing—you’re finally going to have your day. Somewhere out there, right now on this Earth, is the Neil Armstrong of Mars. No one knows who they are—they might not even know who they are—but everyone on Earth will know their name soon.

This is gonna be a big deal.

In addition to being the first time a human has set foot on another planet, it’ll be by far the farthest away from Earth any human has ever gone.

The ISS is about 250 miles (402 km) away from Earth’s surface. The moon is about 1,000 times farther away (239,000 mi / 384,000 km) than the ISS. Mars is more complicated. Think of the Earth and Mars as two people running around a track. Mars, on the outside track, takes about twice as long to run around the track as Earth on its inside track. The two planets are usually on totally different parts of the “track,” and incredibly far away from each other. But every 26 months, Earth “laps” Mars and they pass next to each other on the track—this is when you want to commute between Earth and Mars.

Depending where they are on their orbits when they pass each other, they can get as close as 34 million miles (55m km) from each other. Other times, the moment when they pass will only bring them about 60m miles (100m km) from each other.

Even in the best-case scenario, Mars is far. To compare, let’s bring back our meter-diameter Earth. So if the Earth is a meter in diameter, the ISS is about 1 inch (2.5cm) away from the surface. The moon is about 100 ft (30 m) away. And Mars, depending on the year, is between 2.5 and 5 miles (4–8 km) away. Very different story than going to the moon. If going from the Earth to the moon is crossing the narrowest part of the English channel, getting to Mars is crossing the Atlantic (and getting to the ISS is wading 117 feet (35 m) out from the beach).

One other way to look at it is by absorbing what a light second is:

light second

And then realizing that Mars, at its very closest, is a bit over three light minutes away.

The next time Earth laps Mars and they’re side by side is 2016—too soon to do anything. But when it happens again in the summer of 2018, don’t be surprised if a vehicle with a SpaceX logo on it touches down on Mars. Musk has thrown out a rough prediction of 2025 or 2027 for the Neil Armstrong of Mars to take that famous first step onto the planet.2

But like Neil Armstrong’s famous first step, this will be a great achievement for mankind—not a giant leap. The giant leap comes next.

___________

So with the price of a ticket plummeting downwards and the first crewed Mars mission having opened the floodgates, we’ll be ready to start colonizing. The big question will be, “Who wants to be the first to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to go on a possibly-very-dangerous three-month trip to a much colder Antarctica where you can’t breathe the air or let the sun touch your face??”

One thing we haven’t mentioned yet is the yellow circle:

Venn4

We’ve worked so hard to get the price into an affordable range, but we kind of forgot to ask why Musk thinks anybody would want to go in the first place.

Musk is aware of this issue and is thinking a lot about the yellow circle. In the email above, when he mentioned that “it is more fun to be on a cruise ship than a bus, so I suspect that the 100 people per flight number grows a lot over time, maybe to several hundred”—this is him thinking about the yellow circle. When he talks about the importance of making a return trip to Earth available, and free, to any Mars resident, that’s him thinking about the yellow circle. When SpaceX makes art like this and this and this—that’s them thinking about the yellow circle.

Here’s the simple way to look at the million-people-to-Mars mission: the world will soon have 8 billion people. Over the span of the 21st century, let’s say that 20 billion total people live. To get a million people to Mars within that time, you need one out of every 20,000 people to fall into the middle of the Venn diagram. So assuming those who want to go to Mars will be evenly spread out along the socioeconomic spectrum, it turns into a simple formula:

Fraction

When going to Mars first becomes an option, the price won’t yet be down to $500,000/person, and almost everyone will be horrified at the prospect of actually selling everything and blasting off to another planet—so both fractions will be way too small.

But that’s okay—we won’t need a million people in the green zone to get things started. The US turned into quite a thing, but in the year 1605, the green zone on the “colonizing the New World” venn diagram was tiny. The people who settled in Jamestown and Plymouth were very extreme to do so—the first groups to go to Mars will be as well.

No one’s exactly sure how the transportation will work, but it’ll likely be something like this: the Mars Colonial Transporter will consist of two pieces—the giant, powerful first stage, and the second stage, which will also be the spacecraft. The first stage will launch a spacecraft into Earth’s orbit, then come back down (landing propulsively), refuel, undergo a bit of maintenance, and head back up with another spacecraft. This will go on for a while in the weeks leading up to the point where Earth and Mars are next to each other in orbit. Then SpaceX will send up a tanker of some kind to refuel each of the orbiting spacecraft (which also function as the second stage rockets, so they’ll have spent a lot of their fuel getting themselves into orbit).

By the time the planets are in place, there will be a group of MCT spacecraft—what Musk calls the “colonial fleet”—orbiting the Earth, fueled up and ready to go, and at just the right moment, the fleet will take off for Mars.

Three-to-six months later, the spacecraft will get to Mars, descend through the atmosphere, and land propulsively. The people will get out, probably to a fun welcome celebration put on by the existing residents, and unload everything over the next few weeks.

About two years later, when the planets are again aligned, right around the time Earth is launching the next colonial fleet, the group of spacecraft that came to Mars two years earlier will head back to Earth, carrying anyone on Mars who’s over it.

Three-to-six months later, the spacecraft will arrive back on Earth, land propulsively, and head in for maintenance so they’ll be ready to head back to Mars in two more years.

And repeat.

The earliest settlers will have a hard job, like early settlers always do—they’ll have to build themselves a livable situation, and eventually, get working on the first Martian city. For this reason, Musk guesses that early on, for every spacecraft that goes to Mars carrying people, ten will need to go carrying cargo and supplies.3

Some initial things they’ll need:

Energy. Nuclear is a possibility, but Musk thinks it’ll be mostly solar. Early on, panels will need to be brought from Earth, and Musk has the idea to make them flexible and inflatable so they can be rolled up (like one of those upsetting party blowers).
Oxygen. There will need to be an oxygen-producing plant. Plentiful raw materials include atmospheric CO2 and ground H2O, so making oxygen won’t be that hard.
Water. Lots of ice on the poles and supposedly ice at other latitudes too, as well as ice underground, so I’m sure it’ll be a pain in the ass, but they’ll be able to create a pipe system that brings plenty of liquid water into the settlement.
Food. Farmers and botanists will be needed, along with fertilizer and a pressurized greenhouse.
Inside. You can’t go outside on Mars without a spacesuit or the lack of air pressure will boil your blood, the temperature will freeze you to death, and the sun radiation, without much atmosphere or a magnetic field to block it, will peel your skin off like a serial killer. I’m a big proponent of being indoors on Earth, but on Mars, it’s where life happens. For the first few decades at least, Martian cities will be inside large domes. Early settlers will build a smaller hab to live in while they work on building the larger domed complex. Other insides that will be needed will be for storage, construction, schools, hospitals, and other things humans will need.
Rocket fuel. So the spacecraft can return to Earth. The MCT will use methane as the fuel (for lots of reasons I don’t really want to explain and you don’t really want to hear). Methane is just CH4, so again, between Mars’ CO2 and H2O, this will be doable. They’ll also need to make fuel for ground transportation on Mars—rovers, etc.
Internet. This will be taken care of by satellites (probably SpaceX satellites made in the Seattle operation they’re starting), and it’ll be super fast.
Other obvious equipment. For communication, medical care, construction, etc. etc.
This is a bare-bones list for initial critical survival purposes. But over time, more people will make the migration, the city will be increasingly developed, and the settlers will be able to start building things that make for a decent lifestyle: restaurants, bars, movie theaters, sports facilities, etc.

And then, something will start to happen.

The hardest part will be over, and more people will want to go.

The first return ships will come back with people, and it’ll remind everyone on Earth that it doesn’t have to be a one-way ticket—and more people will want to go.

The people who come back to Earth will be commended for their courage, some of the people on Mars will write best-selling books about their experience, and others will film a little TV show about the early settlement and become household names on Earth—and more people will want to go.

People on Earth will see gorgeous photos of Martians hiking around on Olympus Mons and in Valles Marinaris, a mountain and canyon far bigger than any on Earth—and more people will want to go.

People will hear about being able to jump off a 20-foot cliff without hurting yourself and watch viral YouTube clips of new kinds of extreme sports that can only be played with Mars’ 38% gravity situation—and more people will want to go.

And in case you were wondering if this is going to be a vacation jaunt, Musk explains, “It’s not going to be a vacation jaunt. It’s going to be saving up all your money and selling all your stuff, like when people moved to the early American colonies.”1 But he also points to the excitement and novelty of getting to found a new land—an experience that stopped being possible on Earth centuries ago: “There will be lots of interesting opportunities for anyone who wants to create anything new—from the first pizza joint to the first iron ore refinery to the first of everything. This is going to be a real exciting thing for people who want to be part of creating a civilization.”4

Meanwhile, as desirability increases and the yellow circle grows, SpaceX will continue to innovate, and each 26-month cycle, the price of a ticket will be lower than the last—and the blue circle will grow.

When SpaceX starts demonstrating that sending people to Mars is a viable business opportunity, other entities may jump in to compete. Musk doesn’t believe any entity in the world other than SpaceX is making strides on this problem in a serious way right now (he doesn’t take Mars One seriously), but if others—either private companies or large space agencies like ESA or the Chinese Space Agencies—join the effort for their own selfish reasons, he thinks that’ll be helpful to the cause.

What this all adds up to is that once the first crew lands on Mars, it seems likely that with every Earth-Mars synchronization thereafter, the number of people choosing to migrate will grow—perhaps exponentially. By 2040, Musk thinks there will be a thriving colonial Martian city.

And one day after that, sometime in the future, an incoming fleet will arrive on Mars, and for the first time, the planet’s population will top 1 million.

We’ll have made it to Point B.

___________

Musk probably won’t be around to see us reach Point B. He thinks it’ll take at least 40 or 50 years of fleet migrations to happen, which, if things start in the mid-2020s, brings us to around 2070, when Musk will be 99. But he may get a chance to spend time in a high-tech Martian city. He said he’d like to go later in life, then return to Earth, and eventually head back to Mars for retirement and stay for good—but only on one condition: “I’ll go if I’m certain that SpaceX will be fine without me, and that path will continue.”2

More than any particular Mars population goal, Musk wants to die knowing we’re on our way to what he describes as “the threshold at which even if the spaceships from Earth stop coming, the colony doesn’t slowly die out.” That, he says, “is the critical threshold for us as a civilization to not join the potentially large number of one-planet dead civilizations out there.” A million people is his rough estimate for where that threshold lies, but no one knows for sure.

When—if—we do one day get to that point, only then will we have made the giant leap for mankind Neil Armstrong referred to. Humanity’s future will be much more secure and much more likely to survive deep into the future. The hard drive will be backed up. And somewhere out there, Quignee will throw his napkin in disgust.

Time to bring Barney Frank back into this. When you understand the reasons behind why SpaceX is trying to put people on Mars, doesn’t it make politicians like Frank—the one who called the pursuit “a complete and total waste of money”—seem a bit short-sighted?

When I hear a government saying, “Let’s not worry about going to Mars right now when we still have so many problems right here on Earth”—it sounds to me like a person saying, “I’ll worry about my health later when I don’t have so many bills to pay.” There will always, always be important problems to address on Earth, but if we allow what’s urgent here to prevent us from addressing what’s important in the big picture, we’re allowing ourselves to take a huge existential risk.

The other reason to go to Mars

There are two major reasons Musk wants us to go to Mars, and backing up the hard drive is only one of them. I’ll let Elon tell you about the other himself, in this one-minute clip from my first discussion with him in the SpaceX cafeteria (the clip is here if the player doesn’t show up):5



In this post, we’ve talked mostly about the first, very long-term reason to colonize Mars—what Musk calls “the defensive reason”—and in order to see why that matters, we’ve had to zoom way out. But when he talks about his other reason for pursuing Mars—because he believes it will be “the greatest adventure in history”—Musk is zooming way in. This second reason isn’t about the far future and the fate of the species, it’s about everyone who’s alive right now and the way we’ll all get wrapped up in the adventure, even if we have no interest in going to Mars ourselves—and how that might change how we feel about the world and our lives.

To hammer in the point, Musk references the Apollo missions:3 “Life has to be more than about solving problems. There have to be things that inspire you—that make you proud to be a member of humanity. The Apollo program is certainly an example of that. Only a handful of people went to the moon—and yet, actually we all went to the moon. We went with them vicariously. We shared in that adventure. I don’t think anyone would say that that was a bad idea, that that wasn’t great. We need more of those things—at least we need some of those things.”6

Space used to inspire everyone—that’s why so many children in 1970 wanted to be an astronaut. But I grew up in the 80’s and 90’s, a time when the world’s attention had returned to Earth and space was back to being a sideshow—and no one I knew really thought about being an astronaut. As Ashlee Vance writes, “It seems unfathomable, but the rest of the space industry has made space boring.”4

I’ve always envied everyone who was alive during the excitement of the moon landing in the late 60s. When I’ve thought about The Story of Humans and Space, the 1960s always seemed like a fluky decade of supreme excitement in the middle of an otherwise calm and steady trajectory:

graph fluke

But now, I’m seeing the moon landing more as a precursor of something much bigger. Without realizing it, we may be standing on the precipice of one of the great leaps in biological history, and the moon landing may later be seen as the first labor contraction in the birth of an entirely new era for life on Earth. And somehow, we may actually be alive as that new era dawns.

graph long

Of course, this is the optimistic story—which is what you’d expect to hear in a post about SpaceX whose main source is Elon Musk. There are many other less fun ways this story could play out. Maybe a $500,000 ticket to Mars proves totally impossible. Maybe Musk is wrong in his assumption that there’ll be plenty of will if he can just offer the world a way. Maybe life on Mars turns out to be a living hell that breeds insanity and quickly descends into a lawless nightmare. No one can be sure.

That’s the thing about stories—you don’t know what happens in the pages you haven’t read yet.

But my gut says that we’re probably much closer to the beginning of The Story of Humans and Space than the middle or the end. It seems like we’re right around the end of “Chapter 1: Confined to Earth”—maybe on the very last page. And as the story moves forward, it may begin to take place on a much wider stage than the Earth, making The Story of Humans and Space ultimately indistinguishable from The Story of Humans.

It’s no more possible to predict what will happen in those chapters than it would have been for a farmer in 2500 BC Mesopotamia to envision our world today, but SpaceX—the world’s most ambitious company—is on a mission to write the first pages of Chapter 2 and launch the story in a hopeful direction (assuming you consider a long-lived human species is a hopeful concept).7 Let’s finish up this post by imagining what might happen if they succeed.

A SpaceX Future

Pondering a SpaceX future starts with the question, “If we get a million people onto Mars…what happens next?” Here are some possibilities:

A Blue-Green Mars

Fish need to live in the ocean. Their whole life plan is based on being in the ocean. And if you take a fish out of the ocean, it’s going to agonize for a few minutes and then die.

The Earth’s atmosphere is humanity’s ocean. Every cell in our bodies has been designed to work in the exact conditions that exist on the surface of the Earth—and our demeanor standing on the surface of Mars would match the demeanor of a fish after it’s caught and flopping around in a bucket on a boat.

When you buy a fish as a pet, you get a fishbowl to create a tiny slice of ocean in your house for the fish to live in. When we first move to Mars, we’ll live in a humanbowl—maybe one like this:5

Our humanbowl will be a little bubble of Earth surface conditions, regulating the temperature, air pressure, oxygen levels, and incoming solar radiation to be just the way we like them—and the way the food we’ll grow likes them. If it weren’t for the glass ceiling far above you with a red sky8 beyond it, and the fact that you can jump super high, you might forget you’re not on Earth.

And as a temporary plan, a humanbowl works fine. But life on Mars isn’t a temporary activity—the idea is for a growing human population to live there for thousands of years. That’s why Musk calls Mars “a fixer-upper of a planet.”6

So the next challenge after colonizing Mars will be something even harder—we’ll have to turn Mars into our home. 

We have a word for this. Terraforming. Terraforming a planet means changing its conditions to match Earth’s. And that’s the power of technology—with enough of it, we could literally Earthify an entire planet.

How exactly we’d go about this is highly speculative, of course, and right now all we have is a handful of potential strategies. But the basic process should go something like this:

1) Melt the huge amount of ice on Mars’ south pole.

There’s enough ice on Mars to cover the whole planet with an ocean 36 feet (11 m) deep. If we could melt it, we’d start a chain reaction. We’d melt some of the ice, which would release a lot of CO2 that’s currently trapped inside of it, along with water vapor coming off the now-liquid oceans. These greenhouse gases would densify the atmosphere and begin trapping more and more sun energy, which would further heat things up. More heat would melt more ice, release more CO2 and water vapor, trap in more sunlight, and heat things up even more. An overall temperature increase of only 7 F (4 C) is enough to trigger this runaway greenhouse effect.

There are lot of ideas about how to get this runaway process started—ranging from putting mirrors in space to direct more sunlight at the planet to exploding nuclear bombs on the poles9 to directing an ammonia-laden asteroid to smash into the planet.7

2) Speed things up by pumping super greenhouse-y gases into the air.

Humans could accelerate this process by creating factories that convert elements on Mars into greenhouse gases. CO2 would work, but scientists have other, specially-designed gases in mind too that are far more potent at trapping in sun energy—like methane or chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).8

3) Plant stuff

We’d start with microbes that could survive in a place like Antarctica, then moving onto simple plants like mosses, and eventually, vast evergreen forests.

Then, things start moving by themselves. NASA planetary scientist Chris McKay says, “You don’t build Mars, you just warm it up and throw some seeds.”9 In other words, if you do steps 1–3 above, eventually, this will happen:10

And when that starts happening, one by one, our life-on-Mars problems will begin to be solved. Mars will have weather, the temperature will be cold, but livable, the pressure will be low, but livable—and all of these things will get better and better with each passing year. People will be able to walk around outside without a space suit. But for a long time, not without a mask. Which brings us to the hardest part of terraformation—

4) Make the air breathable. 

Because of both the photosynthesis factories we’ll build and all the real photosynthesis from the new plant life, oxygen levels on Mars will be increasing. But slowly. This is the one step that with our current technology, we can’t do within a century or two. Scientist estimates for how long until the Mars air becomes breathable range from 300 years to multiple millennia.11 So unless there’s a technological breakthrough, for many generations, life on Mars will mean wearing masks outside.

One day, probably more than 1,000 years from now, Mars will be completely terraformed. When that day comes, you’ll see a picture like this—12

—and you won’t know which planet you’re looking at. Earth and Mars will be two normal places that take three months to travel between—just like America and Europe only 100 years ago, before airplanes allowed you to zip back and forth between them. Someone could choose to live their life on Earth but go to college on Mars. A retired couple on Mars might decide to voyage to Earth as an extended travel adventure. Businesses can have headquarters on each planet. Earth people and Mars people will be in close touch, emailing and texting and watching each other’s movies and TV shows (no phone calls or Skype convos though—because data transfer is limited by the speed of light, a message sent from one planet takes between three and 22 minutes to get to the other, depending on the planets’ locations10).

All of this is possible. In a paper on the subject, aerospace experts Chistopher McKay and Robert Zubrin conclude that “a drastic modification of Martian conditions can be achieved using 21st century technology.”

Beyond Mars

One day, this video might be real:



When writer Ross Andersen asked Musk about the prospect of moving beyond Mars to other places in the Solar System, Musk was optimistic: “If we can establish a Mars colony, we can almost certainly colonize the whole Solar System, because we’ll have created a strong economic forcing function for the improvement of space travel. We’ll go to the moons of Jupiter, at least some of the outer ones for sure, and probably Titan on Saturn, and the asteroids. Once we have that forcing function, and an Earth-to-Mars economy, we’ll cover the whole Solar System.”

But, he added, “the key is that we have to make the Mars thing work. If we’re going to have any chance of sending stuff to other star systems, we need to be laser-focused on becoming a multi-planet civilization. That’s the next step.”

In that way, colonizing Mars isn’t just important because we expand outward and back up the hard drive, but also because colonizing Mars turns us into a species that knows how to expand to new planets and terraform them. It builds us what is probably the most important skill a species can have if they’re to survive for a long time.

With enough time, we’ll move out to many other bodies in the Solar System, and we’ll terraform each of them into a place humans can call home. This opens up some weird possibilities. Like hiking through a forest with Jupiter hovering overhead:13

Or a day at the beach, with Saturn out on the Horizon:14

The Solar System could become one vast world for humans. Maybe Jupiter’s moon Europa becomes known as the Solar System’s tech hub, while Saturn’s Titan becomes the place you have to move if you really want to be in the entertainment industry. Maybe some people will spend their whole lives on one heavenly body, while others will be avid travelers and brag that they’ve set foot on 12. Maybe the Solar System’s Grand Congress will make “Earth history” a required class in school, and students all over will grow up yearning to one day visit what they’ll refer to as the Cradle of Civilization, to see its huge animals, famous cities, and ancient ruins.

Outward

We won’t stop there. Spreading through the Solar System will buy us lots of time, and lots of time will lead us to magical new technologies, and at some point, we’ll be capable of making the long journeys to other stars and the Earth-like planets circling them—becoming a multi-solar civilization. Like the earliest settlers to the New World in the 17th century and the earliest settlers to Mars in the 21st century, at first, only the boldest will choose to make the multi-decade migration. And similar to the past, with time, moving your family to other solar systems will become commonplace.

The limitation of the speed of light will mean someone might receive daily updates from an old friend circling another star, but they’ll actually be catching up on what happened ten years ago in the friend’s life, and if they respond with a question, they’ll have to wait 20 years for the answer. The distance will isolate populations from each other, and with enough time, humans in different solar systems will no longer be the same species.

The light of consciousness that flickered on millions of years in the past on humble little Earth will spread throughout the galaxy and into other galaxies, branching into thousands of different life forms. Most beings in the lineage will be hazy on where it all started, but those who know their history will be able to tell you all about the Great Leap, that pinnacle moment in antiquity when their primitive ancestors emerged from the womb and became conquerors.

Sources

Researching this post involved over 100 sources, most of which are are cited in the little gray source footnotes or in hyperlinks throughout the post. Rather than list every one of them here, which isn’t that useful for anyone, I’ll talk more broadly about how I went about my research:

Conversations. I was amazingly fortunate to have a lot of access to Elon Musk during this process. I used that access to ask him my still-unanswered questions after having done significant research and to try to dig into the deeper philosophies behind why he’s doing what he’s doing. I also had extended conversations with a number of senior SpaceX staff, NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Karen Nyberg, and several senior NASA and CASIS staff at the recent CASIS conference.

Websites. My Chrome has had a psychotic couple months and I was all over the place during my research. I found sources the usual ways—googling, scanning the bibliographies of relevant Wikipedia articles, etc. But I found myself on a few especially-helpful sites again and again—spacex.com, nasa.gov, space.com, and this convenient list of manned space launches. Some good stuff on Reddit too, like the space and spacex11 subreddits. I also used this post as an excuse to dig into the sites of two of my favorite space-obsessed internet writers/artists: Randall Munroe’s xkcd (which is full of fascinating comics and posts about rockets, planets, and probes), and Jason Kottke’s kottke.org (where I filtered space-related posts using the space tag).

PDFs. A useful research technique—google “[thing you want to learn about] pdf”. It’s amazing how many rigorously-researched papers from the world of academia are just sitting around the internet with no one to hang out with. For example, you can do a google search to read about the deal with the satellite industry and come up with a hit-or-miss list of not-that-thorough articles, but if you add “pdf” in there, you quickly find this, which ended up being my main source about the satellite industry, and this, which told me everything I wanted to know about space debris.

Books. Like it has for all of these posts, Ashlee Vance’s Musk biography was full of useful tidbits that I used for the post. I also coincided writing this post with listening to the audiobook of The Martian during all showers and commutes, which wasn’t useful to the post at all. But the book is awesome and deliciously technical-in-a-fun-way, and if you liked this post, you should probably read the book.

Watching Musk interviews. If you want to hear more from Musk, there are a ton of Musk interviews on YouTube, many of them gathered on this page. Some good ones: Musk’s interview with Sal Khan, his interview and Q&A at MIT, and this interview where they kept stressing him out by asking him really personal questions. There are also a million awesome videos of SpaceX and other companies’ rockets and engines in action, which can become quite the rabbit hole.

Documentaries. Not SpaceX related, but I’d recommend a couple fantastic documentaries about the Apollo and Space Shuttle programs: Ron Howard’s In the Shadow of the Moon and the six-part When We Left Earth.
